										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Amazon (NYSE:AMZN) shares</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have first-quarter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released this week and are looking to secure a recent price low.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48662" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48662" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AMZN – Daily Chart" width="865" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.png 865w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48662" class="wp-caption-text">AMZN – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMZN is trading at $187.70 and the price has cleared a significant gap that occurred in August last year. The stock can see this as a base for further gains if the earnings are positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big issue for Amazon in the coming quarters is a tariff threat to profit margins. As tariffs were reduced to a 10% flat rate, that can still eat into the company’s profit share on all of its products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer cut its price target on the company by 15%, based on the tariff threat. Analysts revised their relatively bullish target price from $260 to $220. The company still has an outperform rating on the e-commerce firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley analysts said recently that around 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, while roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have &#8220;some China exposure&#8221; that could affect advertising spending plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite tariffs, they expect investors to be pleased with mid- to high-teens growth at AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing platform, “even if margins contract meaningfully” on the e-commerce side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Amazon to report around $155 billion in revenue on Thursday, up 8% year-over-year, according to consensus estimates. Profits are expected to be $14.7 billion, up 41% from a year ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic reports released this week will also be important to the outlook for Amazon shares. GDP growth figures will be released on Thursday for the US and the important </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/analysis/financial-events/non-farm-payroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFP non farm payrolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data will come late on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could boost the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US share markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week if tech earnings are positive and the economy shows some solid foundation after the recent turmoil.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon also releases earnings after the close on Thursday and analysts will have an eye on cloud growth and the recent Prime day sales event.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38651" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="AMZN – Daily Chart" width="876" height="648" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.webp 876w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-300x222.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-768x568.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" />AMZN – Daily Chart</p>
<p>AMZN stock found some support around $182 and that will be the key level for the stock this week.</p>
<p>Supporting Amazon’s e-commerce dominance has been the company’s advertising services and cloud expansion through its Amazon Web Services (AWS). Advertising services revenue for Q2 is expected to rise 22% to $13 billion with AWS revenue expected to gain 17% to $25.86 billion. Amazon is still the largest cloud provider ahead of Microsoft and Alphabet. Overall, Q2 sales are thought to have risen by 10% to $148.63 billion versus $134.38 billion in the year ago quarter.</p>
<p>The Q2 earnings per share performance is expected to be an increase of 63% to $1.03 compared to $0.63 per share a year ago. Estimates say Amazon could surpass earnings expectations up to $1.08.</p>
<p>Analyst Nick Jones said Amazon’s prospects after Microsoft’s report means investors expect about 18% growth from AWS before Microsoft’s earnings.</p>
<p>“We do not believe Amazon’s AWS business is likely to have the same capacity constraints as Microsoft’s Azure business, therefore positioning AMZN to deliver stable-to-accelerating AWS growth trends through the rest of the year,” Jones wrote. “Accordingly, we are incrementally positive and believe it is likely increasing share gains.”</p>

While those three tech giants test the $3 trillion market, the e-commerce giant touched $2 trillion on Wednesday.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-36710 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="AMZN – Daily Chart" width="602" height="430" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.webp 602w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-300x214.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">AMZN – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of AMZN surged above the April high and the previous all-time high from May. Those levels are now support for the stock.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s stock was higher by over 3% on Wednesday following its announcement of the Prime Sales event for 2024 on Tuesday. The company said it will host the annual event for members on July 16- 17.</p>
<p>Investors will be looking for analysts&#8217; expectations for the event after day one last year, when Amazon saw its largest sales day ever. More than 375 million items were sold on the e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>Analysts will also look at the backdrop of recent higher inflation and interest rates as a possible driver for bargain hunters.</p>
<p>A Bank of America note to clients reiterated a buy rating on Amazon&#8217;s shares, saying the retailer is on track to deliver more than 9 billion packages globally in 2024. Amazon &#8220;could now be the largest US shipper, ahead of UPS,&#8221; analysts wrote. &#8220;Delivery speed is also dramatically improved, with nearly 25% of estimated units now delivered same or next day.&#8221; The investment bank raised its price target to $220 from $210.</p>
<p>BofA also said the retailer had cut costs &#8220;to take advantage of the AI frenzy better&#8221; At the same time, its Amazon Web Services segment &#8220;has shown signs of quickening growth. Analysts also said that the company still has a &#8220;runway ahead for efficiency gains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon joined Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, at the $2 trillion market cap level.</p>
<p>Investors will now focus on Amazon&#8217;s Prime Day, which could make or break the recent high price.</p>
