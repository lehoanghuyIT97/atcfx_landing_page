<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURCAD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURCAD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has moved above the 1.4927 level, but the coming data could decide whether the price will fail here or continue to rise to 1.50428. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR vs. CAD rate has been rallying since late June as </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have corrected. Weakness in the Canadian economy has also helped the euro. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GfK consumer confidence data from Germany will be brought to HKT at 2:00 pm on Wednesday. Another release at 3:30 pm is the HCOB manufacturing data release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect a slowdown in consumer confidence from -21.8 to -21 despite the recent interest rate cut. European consumer confidence on Tuesday was also slightly lower, dropping from 14.0 to 13.0. On Tuesday, Spanish European Central Bank official Luis de Guindos said that inflation data &#8220;was practically in line with our projections.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Data-wise, September is a much more convenient month for taking decisions than July was. The current level of uncertainty is huge, so we have to be prudent when making decisions,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De Guindos said the ECB will examine wage growth closely. However, there is also uncertainty over Ursula Von der Leyen&#8217;s reelection and the French elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The German data will be followed by a Bank of Canada interest rate decision later in the evening. Markets expect another 25 basis point cut to 4.5% from 4.75%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Canada is just kind of following the drift down in the commodity complex,&#8221; said Michael Goshko, senior analyst at Convera Canada. &#8220;It&#8217;s all the commodity currencies that are getting beaten up.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada is a major producer of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including oil, which is now trading at a six-week low on concerns about demand in China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is some event risk tomorrow with the Bank of Canada and just how dovish they want to be,&#8221; Goshko said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 25 bps cut could strengthen the Canadian dollar, and weaker German data would also help halt the recent rally.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">EURCAD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>EURCAD has been climbing since February as investors look to capitalize on the potential for a eurozone economic recovery. The 1.4764 level was resistance in December and has capped the price ahead of the data. That will determine a continuation or correction.</p>
<p>The ECB decision comes at 9:15 pm HKT, but traders can see the reaction to the data and capitalize on a higher breakout or a lower breakdown. Canadian trade emerged after that decision and just before the critical ECB press conference.</p>
<p>Canada&#8217;s trade figures are expected to show a C$0.1BN month after a disappointing deficit last month of C$-0.31BN.</p>
<p>The big event will be the ECB&#8217;s press conference, and President Christine Lagarde can update markets on their idea of a summer rate cut from the central bank. The euro economy has shown some signs of improvement, and that has boosted the euro.</p>
<p>The ECB may also be asked about its largest loss in two decades, which was announced recently.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank posted another large financial loss in 2023, burning through the last of its provisions. It said more losses are forthcoming, with higher rates pushing up interest payments to banks.</p>
<p>While the bank said it can operate &#8220;regardless of any losses,&#8221; the accounts have broader implications for its reputation and independence from state money.</p>
<p>The ECB printed trillions of euros over the last decade despite warnings from conservative economists. The losses could amplify those critics and get louder if central banks ask for additional capital from their governments, which could be seen as a public bailout.</p>
<p>The ECB meeting comes this week after the Bank of Canada kept its benchmark interest rate on hold at 5%. The BoC hiked rates by 475 basis points to a 22-year high between March 2022 and July 2023 but has held them there as it attempts to cool inflation while avoiding pushing the country into a recession.</p>
<p>The euro could show volatility if the ECB President adjusts the markets&#8217; expectation of a June rate cut. A &#8220;higher for longer&#8221; quote would send the euro reeling from the resistance level.</p>
