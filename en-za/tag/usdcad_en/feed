<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been pressing higher into January but a rebound in February may have stalled with support at the 1.415 level ahead of the key number support at 1.40.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the US and Canadian economies will come late for the Hong Kong session but could spark some volatility in the pair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US retail sales come at 8:30pm HKT on Monday, with Canadian inflation data at the same time on Tuesday. But with a new Prime Minister, the price moves may be driven by geopolitics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Carney was a former governor of the Bank of England and has taken over from Justin Trudeau. One of his first mandates is to push back on Donald Trump’s designs on Canada as a new US state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his talks with Trudeau, Trump questioned the borders set in the 1908 Treaty signed by former President Teddy Roosevelt and King Edward VII.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World,&#8221; he said, adding that Canadians would pay &#8220;much less tax&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump moved quickly to add 25% tariffs on Canadian goods with aluminium and steel being hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We didn&#8217;t ask for this fight,&#8221; Carney said, but &#8220;the Americans want our resources, our water, our land and our country&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;America is not Canada. And Canada never ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form,&#8221; he added. Carney is keen on reciprocal tariffs against the US, even though he deplores them in principle, and said that &#8220;Canada will win&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short-term, the tariff wars could add to the volatility in the USDCAD and the battle for Canada’s sovereignty is an interesting distraction to economic data.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD v CAD made a sharp move higher on the Trump tariff launch but the pair has moved back to the previous highs. The rejection at higher levels sets up the next path with an uptrend line holding the bullish trend in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/analysis/economic-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic calendar</a> is light this week with the US waiting for ADP employment figures and an ISM services PMI release late on Wednesday. But, the market is ignoring short-term, lagging data as traders try to digest the effect of tariffs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tariff issue took another twist on Monday after President Trump said he would pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico for one month. Both countries have pledged to tighten their borders and Trump has applied a grace period on his 25% tariffs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada and Mexico both agreed to dispatch 10,000 additional troops to the border in order to support police in their fight against illegal migration and drug trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump wrote on social media that he had had a “very friendly” conversation with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and that the soldiers “will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets are in a state of confusion as tariffs could upset the global economy and worsen the deflationary effect on global countries. Trump also reiterated his desire for Canada to become the 51</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state of America. Canada’s Trudeau is against such an idea, but he was facing a potential vote of no confidence in his leadership this month. Trump’s moves were created due to trade imbalances with the likes of Canada. However, many analysts worry about supply and demand issues and the deflationary trend of tariffs. Trump has backed off on tariffs for now but that could change at any time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders should keep an eye on fx trades as the changing environment could lead to swings and new trends.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of USDCAD has soared since October as investors consider the possibility of trade tensions between China and the US under Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic Liberal caucus in Canada is now calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to step down as party leader. Following an Atlantic Liberal caucus meeting the morning of December 23, chair Kody Blois wrote a letter to Trudeau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The discussion this morning centred around the need for you to resign as the Leader of the Liberal Party and to urgently allow for a process to determine a new leader to replace you,&#8221; wrote Blois to Trudeau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible trade tensions and Donald Trump&#8217;s threatened 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods exported to the US, and the opposition parties saying they would support a vote of non-confidence in the new year, are reasons for urging Trudeau to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trudeau has been in charge since November of 2015 and many are seeking a change of path for Canada. Monday saw mixed data from the US with December MNI Chicago PMI unexpectedly falling -3.3 to a 7-month low of 36.9, weaker than expectations of an increase to 43. Pending home sales rose by 2.2% over the month, which beat expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low volumes and thin holiday trading conditions may see some exaggerated moves in different assets. The markets are now awaiting Friday’s December ISM manufacturing index for direction and to assess the health of manufacturing. Expectations are for the ISM Manufacturing Index to slip by -0.2 to 48.2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders are now discounting the chances at 11% for a -25 bp rate cut at the January 28-29 FOMC meeting after Jerome Powell took a hawkish stance at his latest monetary policy meeting.</span></p>

<p><b> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43830" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USDCAD – Daily Chart" width="871" height="493" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart.png 871w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart-300x170.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart-768x435.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px" /></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD – Daily Chart </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the USDCAD exchange rate has pushed above 1.40 and will need the data to continue US dollar strength. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest data comes on Wednesday but traders are likely to see movement into the end of the week. US consumer prices are expected to tick higher by 0.1% and that would add to dollar strength.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bank of Canada interest rate decision will follow for the pair. Traders are expecting to see a 50 basis point cut from 3.75% to 3.25%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts are expecting the BoC to move ahead of Donald Trump’s tariffs on overseas goods. In June 2024, with inflation at 2.7%, the BoC began dropping its overnight rate. As of now, it’s sitting at 3.75%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large cut is not seen as a done deal with some analysts expecting a 0.25%. According to the BMO Canada Economic Outlook released last week, “since June, (BoC) has cut rates by 1.25 per cent, and we expect another cut during their final interest rate meeting in December, as well as a series of cuts through mid-2025. All told, we expect the overnight interest rate to fall from the current 3.75 per cent to 2.5 per cent by the middle of 2025. If anything, the Bank of Canada may be even more aggressive”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data released last week showed the jobless rate had climbed to 6.8%, which is the highest since 2021. That led economists at Scotiabank and the Bank of Montreal to join Canada’s four other major lenders in predicting officials will drop the BoC’s overnight lending rate half-a-per-cent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau travelled to meet Trump over threats of a blanket 25% tariff on Canadian goods when he takes office in January. Trump said he hopes the pair can &#8220;continue our in depth talks on Tariffs and Trade, the results of which will be truly spectacular for all&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada is one of America&#8217;s largest trading partners and it sends around 75% of its total exports to the US. The two countries also share deeply integrated supply chains. On Monday, Trudeau told the Halifax Chamber of Commerce that Canada will respond to the tariffs if they go ahead as planned on 20 January.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been trending lower from highs in early August. Resistance for a dollar rally stands at 1.3590 but there is potential to move lower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data starts late on Tuesday with US ISM Manufacturing PMI data. The market is expecting a rise from 46.8 to 47.8. A reading below is still in contraction territory and highlights weakness in the US manufacturing sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday evening brings balance of trade figures and a Bank of Canada rate decision. Economists are expecting another rate cut from governor Tiff Macklem. The BoC cut its key interest rate to 4.5% in July and Macklem said during a news conference that it would be reasonable to expect further rate cuts if inflation continues to ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cut was widely expected by economists after a slowdown in June inflation. It was the central bank&#8217;s second consecutive rate cut when it cut rates for the first time since March 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If inflation continues to ease broadly in line with our forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate,&#8221; Macklem said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian economy has been weaker than the economy in the United States but traders have started to sell the US dollar as the Federal Reserve embarks on its own path of monetary easing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data on Thursday will come from US services PMI and a stronger reading of 51.5 is expected. Services PMI makes up 90% of the economy and is an important number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts feel the Fed has been slow to start its own interest rate cuts.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think they don&#8217;t want to go beyond what they&#8217;ve already clearly communicated, all the way back in March, when they were suggesting at that time three rate cuts of 25 basis points each. We still have three meetings left. I think we still get those three rate cuts of 25 basis points each, and they&#8217;ll take a very gradual pace from that point forward until the Fed funds target rate gets back to 3%,” said Kevin Mahn at Hennion &amp; Walsh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday will bring employment data from Canada and the United States. With these data releases, the USDCAD will be given a clear path on where it goes next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both central banks reduce rates, traders will focus again on economic strength. Monday in the United States is labour day and many markets will be closed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">USDCAD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>If Monday&#8217;s Canadian dollar strength continues, the USD vs CAD rate will have support below 1.3615.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, data will be released with the Canadian inflation rate at 8:30 pm HKT. The market is expecting a dip to the 2.6% level versus 2.7% last month. That will be followed two hours later by US consumer confidence. Traders will also see US GDP growth figures on Wednesday and PCE inflation figures on Thursday.</p>
<p>Weaker treasury yields have been influencing the price of the US dollar on Monday. Fed officials have signalled that there will be only one rate cut this year, but investors are looking for data or events to speed up that descent.</p>
<p>Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said on Monday that there is enough slack in the Canadian labour market to see growth and create more jobs even as inflation declines.</p>
<p>The central bank joined the ECB this month by cutting its policy rate for the first time in more than four years and said more cuts were likely if inflation continued to show it was on a firm path back to the 2% target.</p>
<p>&#8220;With some slack in the economy, there is room for the Canadian economy to grow and add more jobs even as inflation continues to move closer to the target,&#8221; Macklem said.</p>
<p>He added that officials do not think a significant rise in the jobless rate was needed to hit the 2% inflation target.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has always been a narrow path and we have yet to fully stick the landing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Job search difficulty suggests the government has some room to slow the growth of non-permanent residents without tightening the labor market too much and causing significant labor shortages&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell welcomed an inflation drop in May but said policymakers were still seeking consistent signs that the economy was cooling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see today&#8217;s report as progress and building confidence, but we don&#8217;t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant beginning to loosen policy at this time,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>

This rate cut, the first among G7 nations, instilled optimism for the Canadian economy. Notably, after this development, the Canadian dollar (loonie) reached a near-two-week low against the US dollar.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35289" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAD-194503984.png" alt="USDCAD - 4-Hour Chart" width="1121" height="645" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAD-194503984.png 1121w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAD-194503984-300x173.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAD-194503984-1024x589.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAD-194503984-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD &#8211; 4-Hour Chart</span></p>
<p>The S&amp;P/TSX composite index on the Toronto Stock Exchange rose by 166.84 points (0.8%) to 22,145.02, recovering most of its losses incurred earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%, initiating its first rate cut in four years to alleviate pressure on highly indebted consumers.</p>
<p>Angelo Kourkafas, a senior investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri, highlighted the positive impact of this rate cut on equity markets and bonds. He emphasised the Bank of Canada&#8217;s willingness to start normalising policy while maintaining economic growth, consistent with a soft landing scenario.</p>
<p>The Canadian services economy experienced growth in May for the first time in a year. S&amp;P Global data indicated an increase in new business and a faster pace of hiring.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/analysis/trading-strategies/most-traded-commodities-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commodity</a> prices rose, all major sectors of the Toronto market, including the interest rate-sensitive real estate and resource stock sectors, experienced gains.</p>
<p>Wall Street also witnessed a rally, primarily driven by technology shares.</p>
<p>Reflecting market expectations of further rate cuts by the Bank of Canada, the Canadian 2-year yield decreased by up to 12.7 basis points to 3.929%—its lowest level since February 1.</p>
<p>Swap market data projects 77 basis points in rate cuts by the Bank of Canada this year, compared to 49 basis points of easing anticipated for the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>The prospect of divergence in interest rates between Canada and the US weighed on the Canadian dollar, trading 0.1% lower at 1.3690 to the US dollar (or 73.05 US cents). This movement followed the loonie&#8217;s intraday low of 1.3741, its weakest level since May 23.</p>
<p>Analysts predict that the Bank of Canada may implement at least one more rate cut before the next Federal Reserve meeting <strong>on September 18</strong>, increasing the potential for broader rate differentials and <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currency</a> vulnerability for the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve&#8217;s upcoming policy meetings are scheduled for June 11-12 (when rates are widely expected to remain unchanged) and late July, followed by the September 17-18 meeting.</p>
<p>Based on a Reuters poll, most forecasters anticipate the Fed will reduce its key interest rate in September, followed by another cut later in the year.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll indicates that the Canadian dollar&#8217;s appreciation over the coming year is projected to be more modest than previously anticipated due to the Bank of Canada leading the Federal Reserve in rate cuts and the potential impact of the US election in November on global trade uncertainty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USDCAD exchange rate has economic data ahead this week. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34021" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USDCAD – Daily Chart" width="1060" height="612" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart.png 1060w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart-300x173.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart-1024x591.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USDCAD-–-Daily-Chart-768x443.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1060px) 100vw, 1060px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USDCAD exchange rate has been trading in a price range and could head for the 1.33 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada&#8217;s inflation rate is expected to dip to 2.8% from 2.9% on Tuesday. Due to its softer inflation figures, the US dollar has weakened against various </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s first rate cut, expected in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Canada is also pressured to cut interest rates due to a weak economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business insolvencies have increased 87 percent over the past year to the highest level since the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">global financial crisis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struck in 2008. Unemployment has also surged 20 percent year over year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has also been a slowdown in the previously frothy property market. Home sales in the once-hot Greater Toronto Area have cooled 3.4 percent month over month in April, losing ground in the past three months and down five per cent from year-ago levels. At the same time, new listings have jumped 47 percent yearly, and this new demand-supply backdrop has created the conditions for a flattening out in residential prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman once again said she is open to raising interest rates, citing rising inflation risks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed,&#8221; Bowman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other Fed officials, Bowman said the central bank will need to assess more data, highlighting a decline in inflation, before adjusting interest rates from their current 23-year high.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian dollar has been softer due to a slowing economy. However, now traders are moving to sell the US dollar as lower interest rates are expected.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange rate found support at the 1.35 level and is now looking for a breakout higher. Resistance is around the 1.38-1.39 levels, and an uptrend support line keeps the higher levels in play. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Canada is expected to keep its benchmark rate on hold this Wednesday. It looks for further inflation before delivering its first interest rate cut in four years. Markets are betting that a rate cut could come as early as June. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian inflation eased from a peak of 8.1% in June 2022. Friday&#8217;s labour force survey also showed further weakness in the job market. However, the central bank risks fuelling another rise in house prices with another rate cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Reuters poll found that more than 70% of economists expected the BoC to deliver its first rate cut in June, which was in line with market expectations. Seven predicted the first cut would come in July; the remaining four said September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The economy is really quite frail,&#8221; said Pedro Antunes, chief economist at Conference Board of Canada. The BoC will announce its monetary policy decision on Tuesday evening, and there will also be a US inflation reading ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD will get its guidance for the week following those two announcements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists expect US inflation to rise from 3.2% to 3.4% in the latest month, adding doubts to the US central bank&#8217;s expected rate cut path. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is cooling against other major currencies as investors pull back on their market predictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The latest developments have increased the risk that the (Federal Reserve) could lag behind other major central banks when lowering interest rates,&#8221; currency analysts at MUFG said in their latest research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Another upside inflation surprise could trigger a bigger hawkish reassessment of Fed rate-cut expectations and open the door for the US dollar to break higher,&#8221; they added.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found resistance at the 1.36 level and has since fallen to 1.3506 with some uptrend support. After the recent failure above, the market may look to test the 1.34 level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian dollar also has Balance of Trade figures ahead on Thursday evening with an expected C$0.8 billion versus the previous C$0.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the country failed to reach a two-way trade deal with the United Kingdom. This is expected to add tariffs on cheese, beef, and cars. In 2023, the industry was worth £700 million in exports to Canada. However, costs will now be passed on to Canadian businesses and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada’s GDP growth rate still lags the US by a large margin, with the US seeing 3.4% growth against Canada’s 0.2%. However, there may be some slowing for the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citadel billionaire hedge fund founder Ken Griffin said: “Economic growth is likely to be modest, staying below potential in the upcoming quarters, with the central bank persisting in its fight against inflationary pressures”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are betting that US interest rates will remain significantly higher than the Federal Reserve’s estimates by the end of the coming rate-cut cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, predicted the Fed’s so-called terminal rate would be between 3.25% and 3.5% and that the Fed had “a little bit of status quo bias.” While the Fed has been moving up long-term rate forecasts, it has been moving up “more gradually than I would have predicted,” Hatzius said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada’s dollar continues to benefit from more substantial </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with US crude hitting $86.70 on Thursday. Supply concerns have helped oil maintain a healthy winning streak over the last week. Continued Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries have been another issue helping to push oil prices higher. A stronger employment number could help strengthen the CAD after Friday’s report.</span></p>
