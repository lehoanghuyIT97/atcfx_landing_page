As the official partner, ATFX&#8217;s institutional business, </span><a href="https://www.atfxconnect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATFX Connect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continues to lead this event that connects dreams and the future. Since first sponsoring The Duke of Edinburgh Cup in 2018, ATFX has been the global official partner of this event for seven consecutive years. This long-term and stable partnership not only reflects ATFX’s high recognition of the Duke of Edinburgh Cup but also demonstrates its commitment and dedication to charitable causes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the event, over 100 participants showcased their superb golfing skills, earning rounds of applause. ATFX joined the participants at this moment. Over the past seven years, ATFX has witnessed countless participants sweat and chase their dreams on the field, and also seen ATFX grow from an industry newcomer to a leading global fintech broker. During the event, ATFX sponsored the “Hole In One” segment. If any participant achieved this feat, they would win a BMW car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While immersing ourselves in the competition, ATFX did not forget to give back to society by participating in local charitable donations. Each donation embodies ATFX’s care and responsibility towards society. ATFX hopes that through these actions can inspire more kindness and strength, and together build a more harmonious and beautiful world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Duke of Edinburgh Cup is a charity sponsored by the British Royal Family, dedicated to providing support in health, education, and welfare for young people worldwide. As a broker regulated by a prestigious UK authority, ATFX is steadily expanding its global business footprint. The partnership with The Duke of Edinburgh Cup further highlights the shared vision and international expansion strategy of both parties.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 7, 2024, the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/duke-of-edinburgh-cup-sponsorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duke of Edinburgh Cup</a> kicked off at King David Mowbray Golf Club in Cape Town, South Africa. As a long-standing partner, ATFX has been the official sponsor of the event for seven consecutive years, bringing this charity tournament to countries such as Thailand, Mexico, and Turkey. This year, ATFX introduced this philanthropic initiative to South Africa for the first time, aiming to promote the development of local golf and convey the values of charity and public welfare.</p>
<p>The Duke of Edinburgh Cup has been held in over 24 countries, helping children and young people overcome difficulties and lead better lives. Over the past seven years, ATFX&#8217;s charitable sponsorship has raised up to £170,000. Following last year&#8217;s Turkey qualifiers, ATFX raised funds for children and young people affected by the devastating earthquake in Turkey. Besides charity, there is also competition. In each match, the host country crowns its national champion, who will participate in the world finals held in the UK.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the South African Duke of Edinburgh Cup event, ATFX Chairman Joe Li delivered the opening speech. He expressed gratitude to the organisers for providing a platform for the company to learn about local culture and policies. He hoped that through this event, more help could be extended to those in need. ATFX&#8217;s prominent presence at the venue and in the local community also caught the attention of renowned media outlet The Citizen. In addition to comprehensive coverage of the event, The Citizen interviewed Joe Li and gained a detailed understanding of the group&#8217;s extensive charitable efforts.</p>
<p>In the upcoming period, ATFX will continue to follow up on the subsequent activities of the Duke of Edinburgh Cup, using actions to embody the social responsibility philosophy that the brand has always upheld.</p>
