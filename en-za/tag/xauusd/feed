										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fell over 0.50% on Monday due to decreased safe-haven demand after US President Trump delayed EU tariffs. Low trading volumes persisted with UK and US markets closed. XAU/USD is at $3,336. Market sentiment improved after Trump&#8217;s Sunday tariff postponement until July 9, causing downward pressure on gold after a 4.86% weekly gain (largest since April 7).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, XAU/USD bullish trend continued as Trump pressured Apple to manufacture in the US (threatening 25% tariffs) and suggested potential 50% EU tariffs, driving gold from $3,287 to $3,365. Despite the recent pullback, gold is expected to rise. China&#8217;s net gold imports via Hong Kong significantly increased in April. Geopolitical tensions remain due to Russia&#8217;s continued attacks on Ukraine, met with a strong reaction from Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&#8217;s US economic data includes April Durable Goods Orders, FOMC minutes, Q1 2025 GDP (second estimate), and the Core PCE Price Index.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downward Pressure on Gold Despite Economic Concerns</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices experienced downward pressure despite stable US Treasury yields and a decline in real yields. While concerns regarding US fiscal policy, including Moody&#8217;s recent credit rating downgrade and a significant increase in the debt ceiling, presented a potentially supportive backdrop, increased risk appetite among investors weighed on the precious metal&#8217;s valuation. A marginal depreciation of the US Dollar Index (DXY) to 99 provided limited countervailing support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAU/USD Technical Outlook</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices slightly retreated as traders took profits amid low US liquidity due to a holiday. Trump&#8217;s trade policy uncertainty may cause volatility to resume. Technically, gold&#8217;s bull trend holds. A daily close above $3,300 could lead to testing $3,365, then $3,400, the $3,438 May 7 high, and the $3,500 ATH. Conversely, falling below $3,300 may trigger a move to the $3,204 May 20 low and the $3,199 50-day SMA.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold’s recent correction on an end to tariffs chaos has created a pullback scenario. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50349" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50349" style="width: 787px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50349" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="XAUUSD – Daily Chart" width="787" height="541" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 787w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x206.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x528.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50349" class="wp-caption-text">XAUUSD – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAUUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has pulled back the previous highs above $3,400 and needs to find buyers to avoid a larger pullback. There is some hope with the price action into the  weekend but a failure would move back toward $3,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highs in gold were created with strong inflows to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments. Global exchange-traded funds backed by bullion reported their highest monthly inflows since 2022 in April, World Gold Council (WGC) showed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The month ended with 3,561 tonnes locked up in ETFs, after a 115 tonne rise from March. Holdings reached unseen levels since the pandemic period of October 2020. The total value of April inflows was $11 billion, marking a fresh record of $379 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asia was the big driver with almost two-thirds (65%) of the worldwide total. Monthly inflows of $7.3 billion were the strongest on record, pushing AUMs in the region to $35 billion. Physical holdings rose to 320 tonnes, marking a 70-tonne monthly increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 90-day pause in tariffs has supported the market but may also lead to a larger correction if there is a longer-term deal between the US and China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downgrade of US debt by Moody’s has added some further uncertainty to demand for the greenback but may not be enough to hold onto the uptrend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ongoing trade dispute with the US, which has raised fears of weaker growth, amplified equity volatility, and intensified expectations of the local currency depreciation” also boosted gold demand, as did weaker government bond yields,” the WGC report said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economist Peter Schiff was critical of Bitcoin again, saying: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rallied with other risk assets as investor&#8217;s recession and inflation fears subsided. Gold sold off for the same reasons. Bitcoin is the opposite of gold”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His comments came after JP Morgan analysts said BTC could outperform gold in the second half of the year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China has rocked the price of gold by dumping tonnes of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">precious metal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the market. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48780" style="width: 919px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48780" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XAUUSD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="XAUUSD - Daily Chart" width="919" height="565" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XAUUSD-Daily-Chart.png 919w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XAUUSD-Daily-Chart-300x184.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XAUUSD-Daily-Chart-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48780" class="wp-caption-text">XAUUSD &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAUUSD price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has pulled back from highs above the $3,400 level and trades at $3,235. Larger support comes in at $3,000 for bullion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold dropped to a two-week low on signs of potential trade progress between the US and other nations, reducing demand for a safe haven despite worries about weakening economies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices were lower again by more than 2% as investors weighed improving sentiment on Wall Street after US President Donald Trump’s trade representative said he was nearing an announcement of the first trade deals. A report stated that the US had been talking to Beijing, which added to the positive sentiment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The precious metal is up more than 23% this year after hitting a record above US$3,500 last week. The move started in 2024 with central banks being strong supporters of gold, with China and Turkey among the biggest buyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has been the big driver of the metals trade and China stepping back is a big concern for gold. China had been seeing a huge inflow of money into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold ETFs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now investors may have to soak up losses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports last week said the Chinese government had dumped tonnes of gold on the market and will raise alarm bells about the timing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia could ease the demand for gold, while the imminent trade agreements will further reduce the desire for gold. The central bank buying has been a key theme for 1-2 years and if China believes the metal is overpriced then speculative money could come back out of gold.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices surged to a new record high following Trump&#8217;s criticism of Fed Chair Powell for not implementing rate cuts, labeling him a &#8220;major loser.&#8221;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index (DXY) fell sharply to 97.92 amid concerns about the Federal Reserve&#8217;s independence and persistent stagflation risks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market participants are closely watching upcoming speeches from Fed officials Jefferson, Harker, and Kashkari this week, as policy uncertainty intensifies.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-48257"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commenced the week with an increase, appreciating over 2.56% and achieving a new record high of $3,430 amidst uncertainty regarding statements that could impact the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) autonomy. Currently, XAU/USD is trading at $3,419, subsequent to reaching a daily low of $3,329.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for gold has risen as US President Donald Trump maintains pressure on the Fed, criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell and asserting that he consistently acts belatedly in lowering borrowing costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the preceding week, Powell indicated that the US central bank has adopted a cautious approach and alluded to the potential for a stagflationary situation, acknowledging the possibility of “a challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escalating tensions between Trump and Powell, coupled with contentious trade policies, have negatively affected the US Dollar, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) declining to a three-year low of 97.92.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of economic data, the US economic calendar is presently sparse; however, activity is anticipated to increase, predominantly driven by Federal Reserve officials’ remarks. Vice-Chair Philip Jefferson, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari are scheduled to deliver speeches on Tuesday.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Price Reaches Historic High Despite Elevated US Yields</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US 10-year Treasury yield increased by four basis points to 4.373%, yet this increase did not constrain gold prices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US real yields also increased, rising by three and a half basis points to 2.14%, as evidenced by the US 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities yields.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fixed income markets, money market participants have priced in 94.5 basis points of Federal Reserve rate reductions by the conclusion of 2025, with the initial rate cut anticipated in July.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&#8217;s US economic calendar features numerous speeches from Federal Reserve officials, S&amp;P Global Flash Purchasing Managers&#8217; Indices, Durable Goods Orders, and the final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment reading.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAU/USD Technical Analysis: Gold Price Expected to Approach $3,450 in the Short Term</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upward trajectory of gold prices remains intact, with the potential to test the $3,500 level forecasted by Citi within the next quarter. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered overbought territory, suggesting a possible price retracement; however, exceeding the recent peak may propel bulls toward $3,450 in the near term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, should XAU/USD decline below $3,400, initial support would be found at the April 17 high of $3,357, followed by $3,300.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">XAUUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">price of XAUUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has tumbled by almost $150 in two days as traders unwind long positions. That will now be the resistance barrier with further support above $2,800.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve Chair Powell spoke about the economy at a conference in Virginia and said that monetary policy is well-positioned to wait for further clarity. Powell said tariffs were “likely to raise inflation in coming quarters, with more persistent effects possible”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that measures of long-term inflation are “well anchored” and that the central bank&#8217;s obligation is to ensure that a “one-time increase in price levels doesn&#8217;t become an ongoing inflation problem”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed Chair also added that the economic outlook is highly uncertain and that despite the fact that the economy is in a good place, downside risks have risen. Money market traders had priced in over 1% of Fed easing by 2025 due to the economic outlook. However, markets are now pulling back on the gold surge as doubts emerge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent selling, Deutsche Bank has raised its average gold price forecast in recent days. The investment bank said that 2025 and 2026 should see bullion at $3,139 and $3,700 per ounce respectively, driven by economic and geopolitical developments around the world. The bank had previously forecast an average price of $2,725 for this year, and $2,900 for 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investment banks with plus $3,000 price targets for 2025 include BofA, Goldman, and HSBC. The lowest target is $2,763, shared by Morgan Stanley and Australia’s ANZ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s central bank added gold to its reserves in March for the fifth straight month, according to official data from the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC) last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banks have been keen buyers of physical metals and that could continue as the tariff environment adds uncertainty to the world economy.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">XAUUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of XAUUSD has moved above resistance at the $2,958 level to reach a new high above $3,043. Unless there is a shift in the U.S. dollar, then it can continue to increase.</p>
<p>Markets expect the gold rally to continue due to economic slowdown and recession risks, partly driven by President <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025">Donald Trump&#8217;s tariffs</a>.</p>
<p>Peter Walden, director at BullionByPost, the UK&#8217;s largest online dealer, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Since January, following president Trump&#8217;s inauguration — and with activity peaking in February — we&#8217;ve observed a marked rise in retail investors seeking to add physical gold to their portfolios. Amid economic uncertainty and inflation concerns, many are turning to gold as the ultimate safe haven&#8221;.</p>
<p>His company has seen an increase of 137% in gold sales this year compared to last.</p>
<p>The gold price has paused in the last two days after the Federal Reserve kept rates steady and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the impact of tariffs would be short-term.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s kind of the base case,&#8221; he said, adding that the central bank can&#8217;t really know the total impact tariffs will have at this moment. However, some analysts are not convinced that the tariff effects will be &#8220;transitory&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk is that tariffs could have a longer-lasting effect on inflation if additional tariffs are added later this year, or if tariffs push up inflation expectations and wage expectations,&#8221; Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Slok told Fortune.</p>
<p>Trump said the central bank should cut interest rates while the tariffs work their way into the economy.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar unwind has been a big contributor to the recent gold move, and investors see central bank gold buying continuing to support the upward trend. With the current mood, any pullback could be seen as a discount for many bullish traders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>U.S. Dollar index (<a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDX</a>)</strong> has been under pressure lately as tariffs threaten to induce a recession in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46955 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="USDX_Weekly_Chart" width="873" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart.png 873w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart-300x196.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">USDX &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p>The <strong>USDX</strong> stalled last week after sharp losses in the prior week and we may see a move to the 100 level coming over the next week or two.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar has been falling and gold is on the riser as traders look for a safe haven after recent market volatility.</p>
<p>Daan Struyven, from the commodities division of Goldman Sachs, said that global economic uncertainty is heightening fears of a weaker U.S. dollar while driving higher demand for gold. In a recent interview on CNBC, Struyven said  that many investors and central banks are on a gold-buying spree as they move to safe assets to guard against Donald Trump’s tariff policies.</p>
<p>Traders are also preparing for the upcoming Federal Reserve policy meeting set for Wednesday. Although the CME Group FedWatch tool shows a 99% probability that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, markets will be watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting comments for any hints on the future policy direction.</p>
<p>Powell has consistently played down expectations for rate cuts, reinforcing the Fed’s cautious approach and that has hurt the USDX. Recent economic data has pointed to a slowdown in the general economy and that may be a factor in Powell’s latest appearance.</p>
<p>“The broader driver here is uncertainty and risks, downside risks to the US and the global economic outlook, and that is pushing down some of the more procyclical commodities closely tied to US growth, such as oil, but it’s supporting gold,” Struyven said. “We have seen very significant increases in investment demand for gold, and we’re seeing very rapid buying from central banks for gold as well”.</p>
<p>“Our forecast base case for (<strong><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold</a></strong>) year-end is $3,100 per ounce. But we think that the risk to this base case and to our $3,100-$3,300 range are skewed to the upside. It’s pretty remarkable. We have seen a rally despite a decline in speculative positioning. So positioning is a lot cleaner than before the rally”.</p>
<p>The current dynamic could put the USDX on a path to the key 100 support level and it may come with the central bank meeting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of gold is trading in a small range ahead of the all-time high and will look to break to the upside or the downside.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46774" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="XAUUSD – Daily Chart" width="842" height="502" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 842w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x179.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">XAUUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAUUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a base on Tuesday and may make a move toward the all-time high at $2,950. Downside support comes in ahead of $2,825.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold continued an uptrend from February, hitting multiple new highs before pulling back to end the month. The move was echoed across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">major currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as global risks increased with tariffs and war threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The World Gold Council’s Gold Return Attribution Model (GRAM), dollar weakness during the month was one of the primary drivers of gold’s outperformance. The increase in geopolitical risk and a drop in interest rates added to the gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large portion of the buying came from gold </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> activity, which saw massive net inflows of US$9.4bn (100t), marking the strongest month since March 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gold has been consolidating in the midst of mayhem within striking distance of the all-time high,&#8221; said Mizuho&#8217;s Robert Yawger. &#8220;it is still only one big day away from ringing the bell&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold does hit new highs, it may go further as investors divert money from beaten-down tech stocks into bullion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another driver of gold has been the theory that there is gold missing from Fort Knox, the strategic store in the US. Donald Trump said he will personally investigate the issue but investors are considering the need for further gold purchases from the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That theory was backed up by a surge in US imports as the country imported a record $329.5 billion worth of goods in January, $36 billion more than the prior month. Data from the Commerce Department showed that finished metal shapes, which include gold bars, accounted for nearly 60% of the monthly increase in imports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend for physical gold could continue and ETF flows will continue if new highs arrive in the next week or so.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rose by 0.23%, trading near $2,939 at the time of writing, driven by trade war concerns, a weak US Dollar, and falling US Treasury bond yields. The demand for gold was fueled by uncertainty surrounding global trade and risk aversion, which led investors to seek safe-haven assets like gold and the Japanese Yen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Meeting Minutes revealed concerns about rising prices due to Trump&#8217;s trade and immigration policies. As a result, the Fed decided to keep rates unchanged at the January meeting. Some Fed speakers have expressed caution, with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic predicting two rate cuts this year and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem highlighting increased risks of inflation exceeding the Fed&#8217;s 2% goal. Chicago&#8217;s Fed President Austan Goolsbee noted that Trump&#8217;s tariff policies are keeping the Fed nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US job data was softer than expected, and Gold traders are now eyeing the release of S&amp;P Global Flash PMIs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market Drivers:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US President Donald Trump&#8217;s announcement of tariffs on cars, automobiles, and computer chips, and potential tariffs on other commodities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Initial Jobless Claims exceeding forecasts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US 10-year Treasury bond yield falling three basis points.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US real yields dropping three basis points.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central bank purchases of gold rising more than 54% YoY following Trump&#8217;s victory.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money market fed funds futures pricing in 41.5 basis points of easing by the Fed in 2025.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAU/USD Technical Outlook:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold price uptrend remains intact, but the failure to clear the $2,950 figure could lead to a pullback. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that sellers are gaining momentum. If XAU/USD falls, support levels are at $2,877 and $2,864. If it rises past $2,954, resistance levels are at $2,950 and $3,000.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has shaken off its late-2024 correction to surge higher toward the $3,000 level. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45680" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="XAUUSD – Daily Chart" width="729" height="541" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 729w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/XAUUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">XAUUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAUUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has soared again from December lows near $2,600 to a current price of $2,906. A move to the $3,000 level soon would be the possible target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold finished January at an all-time-high of US$2,812, up 8% for the month, adding another positive start to its strong January record. The all-time-highs were also made against all </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">major currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, resembling a global trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese gold market activity appears to also have stayed true to a seasonal pattern and suggests there may be some follow-through into February. The European economy has settled but there is the potential that German elections could further pressure the US dollar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EU’s largest economy is heading to the polls on February 23 to elect a new parliament. The vote will likely trigger a change in national leadership, with Friedrich Merz’s conservatives in the top spot to lead the next government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big slowdown in the country’s prospects has hurt the larger eurozone economy and the current tariffs are a risk. A new leadership may help the economy to get started and move the country and region forward again.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is interesting that gold is also surging despite the recent Gaza ceasefire and talk of peace talks for Ukraine and Russia. Donald Trump held two long phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy and said he would visit Russia and offered to host Putin in the US. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negotiations would begin &#8220;immediately&#8221;, Trump said, as he bids to end the two country’s three year long war. He said it was impractical for the Ukraine to join NATO and it was unlikely to get all of its occupied land back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market may distrust a peace process and the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">precious metal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continues to surge higher.</span></p>
