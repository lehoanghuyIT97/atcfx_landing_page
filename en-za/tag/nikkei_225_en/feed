										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese inflation data will be released on Friday, and it could test the recent bounce in Nikkei stocks. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">JPN225 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JPN225</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has bounced from the low in early August and is trading just above support. Inflation data and weakness in the US indices on Thursday may bring sellers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation data was released at 7:30 am HKT, and traders were looking at last month&#8217;s 2.8% rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent comments from Japanese policymakers have hinted at further rate hikes. They could hurt the Nikkei if traders see additional rate hikes coming. A higher-than-expected inflation number would put pressure on policymakers to act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent reading of wholesale inflation released last week showed the fastest year-on-year pace in 11 months. A weaker yen pushed </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/bz/en-za/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> import prices higher for the economy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Bank of Japan, the corporate goods price index (CGPI) highlights the price companies charge each other for goods and services, which climbed 3% in July from a year ago. An economist survey showed that 57% expect the Bank of Japan to raise rates again this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The current policy rate is extremely accommodative,&#8221; said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research. &#8220;The BOJ will continue to raise interest rates toward the neutral rate as long as the 2% price stability target is expected to be achieved&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, the BOJ surprised many market participants by raising borrowing costs to 0.25% from 0%-0.1%. Governor Kazuo Ueda&#8217;s comments signalled the potential for further rate hikes in coming years. That led to a surge in the yen and a collapse in the Nikkei index. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is too early to assume that the market turmoil after the July additional rate hike has changed the path the BOJ envisions for rate hikes,&#8221; Kazutaka Maeda at Meiji Yasuda Research said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That outlook could be determined by the coming inflation figures and continued strength in the Japanese economy. Japan&#8217;s economy grew by a much faster-than-expected 3.1% annual rate in the second quarter, recovering from a slump at the start of the year after consumption increased. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short term, Thursday&#8217;s sell-off in US stocks could hurt Asian stocks on Friday. Investors will then look ahead to Nvidia&#8217;s earnings release next week.</span></p>
