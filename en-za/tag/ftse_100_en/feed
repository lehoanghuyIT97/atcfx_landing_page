										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK stocks were in focus on Wednesday as the country’s Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivered his spring Budget statement, including measures to boost investment in the City of London financial centre.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30563 aligncenter" src="https://.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UK100-Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="UK100-Daily-Chart" width="730" height="615" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UK100-Daily-Chart.jpg 730w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UK100-Daily-Chart-300x253.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FTSE 100 (UK 100) &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK’s FTSE 100 share index</a> closed slightly higher, but the market is stuck in a range with resistance at the 7,750 level holding up since December 2023.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 was relatively steady following the lunchtime UK speech, indicating that there were no major surprises for investors.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hunt’s Budget included plans for a British ISA, which will give investors an additional £5,000 tax-free allowance to invest exclusively in UK companies when they have used up the current £20,000 yearly limit.</p>
<p>The new measures saw a mixed response from savings and investment experts, with some suggesting that it will have a limited impact on the City as it helps wealthy investors. However, the new ISA has the potential to drive new capital flows to UK companies, including small and mid-cap companies.</p>
<p>Chris Cummings, chief executive of Investment Association Other said that the measure could encourage people to abandon diversification.</p>
<p>The Chancellor’s Budget was safe and unlikely to lead to any fallout in global markets, but the cautiously optimistic tone of Jeremy Hunt’s speech helped to boost the British pound.</p>
<p>The performance of the FTSE in contrast to US stocks is evident in the stock chart and it is a worry that the market is showing such weakness when markets are happy. US stocks are higher due to the concentration of big global brands in the US indices.</p>
