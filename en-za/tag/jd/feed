										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese retailer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD.Com (HKEX:9618)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will release earnings on Thursday with analysts keen to find out more about food delivery. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46421" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/9618-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="9618 – Daily Chart" width="765" height="547" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/9618-–-Daily-Chart.png 765w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/9618-–-Daily-Chart-300x215.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">9618 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of JD is finding some support ahead of earnings and could make a move to the 192 resistance area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors in JD.com Inc. will be tested by the earnings report from the online retailer as it looks to enter the food-delivery space currently dominated by Meituan. JD.com officially launched its JD Takeaway platform in February, while many of its tech peers were pivoting to artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has already struggled in a price war in e-commerce with Alibaba Group and PDD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The food delivery business is very tough — taking on Meituan,” said Jonathan Pines, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. “They’re worried about their core business, perhaps, and they’re looking for growth. So it was a negative development, and I think the market took it negatively”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD.com’s Hong Kong shares are up around 6% this month, trailing Meituan’s 17% rise and Alibaba’s AI-driven rally of more than 50%. The options market shows traders are expecting a move of 8% in either direction for JD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors will be keen to see how much the company is planning to spend on its entry into the food delivery business. The investment could “drag on margins if they decide to be aggressive,” said Xin-Yao Ng, investment director at Abrdn in Singapore. “Meituan has built a very strong moat, so it’s fine if it’s a limited attempt, but will be bad if they talk about going all out”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD.com’s growth has started to accelerate with some assistance from global subsidies on household appliances, though it’s still well below previous highs. The retailer already has tight margins compared to other firms and a big push into food delivery could see shares affected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the Q4 results, analyst Gregory Zhao at Barclays set a price target of $55 per share, which would be a 37% upside from current levels. He expects to see a 10% year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>JD.com (NYSE:JD)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has earnings ahead on Thursday as the stock looks to find buyers again. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42903" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/JD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="JD - Daily Chart" width="955" height="628" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/JD-Daily-Chart.png 955w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/JD-Daily-Chart-300x197.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/JD-Daily-Chart-768x505.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">JD &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of JD is testing levels around the $40 mark after the stimulus-led surge to $48 has given way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD.com Inc. will provide more insight into the growth momentum of the Chinese economy, after investors were disappointed by the size of stimulus measures from a high-profile policymakers’ meeting last week.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outlook for the retail giant will be in the spotlight as Beijing’s plan only included a 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) package to tackle hidden debt issues faced by local governments but stopped short of providing new stimulus to bolster consumption. Investors are now expecting more direct measures to stimulate the economy after Donald Trump takes office in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD.com, which is operating in a soft retail landscape, may introduce larger discounts to stimulate consumption during Singles’ Day, the country’s largest annual shopping day. China’s trade-in program to boost appliance demand and consumer goods may also help sales during the November 11 event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consensus estimate for earnings per share is $1.04 (+13.0% Y/Y) and for revenue, analysts expect to see $36 billion (+6.1% Y/Y). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attention will turn to Trump’s plans after he had suggested a tougher stance on Beijing with tariffs and that added to a recent post-stimulus sell-off. The incoming US President is expected to go through with his campaign promise to hike tariffs as high as 60% to 100% on goods from China, and 10% to 20% on all other imports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD has almost no US business, with none of it being direct exports, so the exposure is limited to providing logistics to Chinese companies trying to enter the US market. That could boost JD stock if the earnings come in better than expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, JD can be a good Chinese long position for Trump’s second term. The company’s stock will likely be affected by tariff talk and can offer a discount to savvy investors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the third quarter earnings ahead, the company’s shares will be looking for buyers to emerge around the $40 level.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese e-commerce retailer JD.Com saw its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rise after beating Wall Street earnings expectations.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39324" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/JD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="JD – Daily Chart" width="898" height="631" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/JD-–-Daily-Chart.png 898w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/JD-–-Daily-Chart-300x211.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/JD-–-Daily-Chart-768x540.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">JD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> release, the price of JD jumped to $27 and secured support at $24.70 and $25.57 on the ADR. The next target for gains is $29. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company reported higher second-quarter revenue driven by gains in retail and logistics, while earnings were well ahead of analysts&#8217; expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue was up 1.2% in the three months through June 30 to 291.4 billion renminbi ($40.7 billion), slightly lower than the consensus for 291.7 billion renminbi. Net income was higher by 74% to 9.36 renminbi, blowing away the Wall Street expectation for 6.19 renminbi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD Retail revenue grew to 257.07 billion renminbi from 253.28 billion renminbi a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Ian Su Shan said logistics revenue was up 7.7%. In comparison, new business fell 35% due to &#8220;adjustments&#8221; in its Jingxi shopping platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s electronics and home appliances sales fell 4.6% yearly, while general merchandise rose 8.7%, boosted by the supermarket segment. The company&#8217;s share rose around 4.6% on the news Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Despite the mixed top-line performance, we saw broad-based profitability improvement across many categories and segments, which effectively contributed to record highs&#8221; in non-GAAP operating profit and net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, management said. Gross margins at the firm also hit a record high of 15.8%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retailer&#8217;s total quarterly active customers grew at a double-digit pace year-on-year for a third straight quarter while shipping frequency and volume were also up by double digits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robust earnings could see JD stock climb higher from recent support.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce giant JD.Com released its latest earnings on Thursday with a beat on revenue expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33894" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/JD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="JD – Daily Chart" width="868" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/JD-–-Daily-Chart.png 868w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/JD-–-Daily-Chart-300x215.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/JD-–-Daily-Chart-768x550.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">JD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are moving higher in an uptrend channel, with the price seeing initial resistance. Further strength in Chinese shares can cause the stock to move higher again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD.com has strategically responded to market dynamics, mirroring its rival Alibaba by adjusting prices and offering discounts to maintain its e-commerce market share. This proactive approach, coupled with the growing preference of Chinese consumers for low-cost platforms, has bolstered JD.com&#8217;s position. The company&#8217;s expansion into logistics, electronics, and home appliances segments demonstrates its adaptability and potential for future success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD.com&#8217;s net profit rose 3.4% to 8.9 billion yuan ($1.23 billion), and revenue was up 7% to 260 billion yuan in January-March, versus the 257.72 billion yuan analysts had expected. JD.com reported net income of 7.13 billion yuan, up nearly 14% from 6.26 billion yuan a year earlier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD.com cancelled a potential plan to purchase the warehouse and store network of British electrical retailer Currys, which could have seen it expand further in the UK and Europe. The company has been less aggressive with its expansion plans than its domestic peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent economic indicators have shown a pick-up in the Chinese economy. US investment banks estimate the country will match the government&#8217;s annual 5% gross domestic product target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That can help JD&#8217;s prospects in the months ahead, as the Chinese consumer could start to move beyond discount items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the recent trade tariffs from the Biden government pose a challenge, JD.com&#8217;s strong performance and strategic positioning provide a sense of security. The company&#8217;s resilience and adaptability amid economic stresses between the world&#8217;s two largest economies reassure investors and financial analysts about its long-term prospects.</span></p>
