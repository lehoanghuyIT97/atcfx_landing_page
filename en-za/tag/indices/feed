<p style="text-align: center;">CH 50 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China 50 index</a> surged to 12,316 on Tuesday, taking out four levels of resistance that were previously identified. The current level is the obstacle to further gains, with the May highs near 13,000 now in sight.</p>
<p>China unveiled its largest set of economic stimulus measures since the pandemic as it attempts to kickstart growth in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China said it had cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points and the amount banks must hold as cash reserves, known as reserve requirement ratios, by 20 basis points.</p>
<p>PBoC governor Pan Gongsheng said the measures should &#8220;support the stable growth of China&#8217;s economy&#8221; and &#8220;promote a moderate rebound in prices&#8221;.</p>
<p>Economists have been doubting the government&#8217;s 5% annual growth target as the economy battles <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/analysis/trading-strategies/deflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deflation</a> and weak demand. Some economists are also unsure whether the latest measures would sufficiently address China&#8217;s broader economic problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a step in the right direction,&#8221; Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China Economics at Capital Economics said. &#8220;But it will probably be insufficient to drive a turnaround in growth unless followed up with greater fiscal support&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lynn Song, chief economist for China at ING, said there was &#8220;still room for further easing in the months ahead as most global central banks are now on a rate-cut trajectory&#8221;.</p>
<p>The 50 basis point cut from the Federal Reserve last week and the similar cut from China is a sign that central banks are worried about the trajectory of the global economy. Asian equities were boosted by the Hang Seng by more than 3%, while a 1.51% gain also supported oil.</p>

<p>An aggressive <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/analysis/market-news/eurusd-exchange-rate-quiet-50bps-fed-rate-cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 basis points rate cut</a> from the Federal Reserve has led to a breakout in US stocks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40809 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP500-–-Daily-Chart.avif" alt="SP500 – Daily Chart" width="903" height="568" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP500-–-Daily-Chart.avif 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP500-–-Daily-Chart-300x189.avif 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP500-–-Daily-Chart-768x483.avif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SP500 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP500</a> has broken above the July resistance level at 5,680. These new highs can lead to further gains. Investors should beware of a false breakout where a move back below 5,680 could lead to a correction.</p>
<p>Investors were optimistic that the Federal Reserve’s half-percentage-point rate cut will steer the US economy onto a “soft landing.” In contrast, others anticipate further economic data and an earnings report from delivery services giant FedEx.</p>
<p>The Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate by the most since 2008, and its first rate reduction in over four years. The Federal Open Market Committee voted by 11 to 1 to reduce the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% after it remained elevated for one year.</p>
<p>In the central bank’s statement, policymakers said they will contemplate “additional adjustments” to rates depending on “incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned against expecting a similar pace in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2%,” Powell said.</p>
<p>Projections released after the central bank’s two-day meeting showed that 10 out of 19 policymakers supported cutting rates by at least an additional half-point during the two remaining 2024 meetings. The projections also showed an extra percentage point of cuts in 2025.</p>
<p>The Fed has a reputation for not rushing any policy changes, so there’s the potential for some disappointment at later meetings, especially if the data changes. However, a weak jobs market was one of the key reasons for the interest rate cut.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 broke above key resistance, and after the much-anticipated rate cut, further catalysts will need to remain elevated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After defying gravity for months, US stocks look set for a correction after chip stocks tumbled.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40264 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="SP 500 – Daily Chart" width="868" height="607" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.webp 868w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-300x210.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-768x537.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SP 500 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP 500 index</a> sank from recent resistance to trade at 5,258. There is now a risk that spooked investors will increase their sales.</p>
<p>Stocks were sharply lower on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 posting a 2-week low and the Nasdaq 100 a 2-1/2 week low. The weakness was driven by chip stocks, which have been the big driver of the AI-driven stock market rally. Nvidia’s earnings last week failed to impress investors, and the market is now on edge.</p>
<p>Weaker-than-expected ISM manufacturing and construction spending reports from the US economy hurt stocks. There was also concern that weakness in China’s economy will continue to weigh on the global outlook. China’s own manufacturing PMI unexpectedly dropped by -0.3 to a 6-month low of 49.1, despite analysts’ expectations for a move higher to 49.5.</p>
<p>Markets will now look to the important services PMI figures for the US, and a weak number could reignite recession fears. Services are 90% of the US and are tied to consumer and business activity. Services PMI is expected to dip from 51.4 to 51.1, with the 50 level being the important line in the sand for expansion. A move toward 50 or lower could add to recent stock selling.</p>
<p>That will then focus on the latest job numbers, with the country seeing a recent downgrade in previous job additions. The market is expecting to see 160k jobs added to the economy after a 114k print last month.</p>
<p>Traders are now pricing a 100% chance for a -25 bp rate cut at the September 17-18 FOMC meeting and at 38% for a -50 bp rate cut at that meeting.</p>
<p>However, further economic weakness could dampen any excitement for interest rate-fuelled expansion in the economy. After the recent surge in stock prices, the S&amp;P 500 is at risk from bad news that could create a steeper correction in the market.</p>
<p>Geopolitical risks remain with intensified fighting between Ukraine and Russia, while a ceasefire is not a reality in the Middle East at the moment. There is also the upcoming US election in November, which could see a big difference in policy depending on the winner.</p>
