										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>U.S. Dollar index (<a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDX</a>)</strong> has been under pressure lately as tariffs threaten to induce a recession in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46955 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="USDX_Weekly_Chart" width="873" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart.png 873w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart-300x196.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">USDX &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p>The <strong>USDX</strong> stalled last week after sharp losses in the prior week and we may see a move to the 100 level coming over the next week or two.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar has been falling and gold is on the riser as traders look for a safe haven after recent market volatility.</p>
<p>Daan Struyven, from the commodities division of Goldman Sachs, said that global economic uncertainty is heightening fears of a weaker U.S. dollar while driving higher demand for gold. In a recent interview on CNBC, Struyven said  that many investors and central banks are on a gold-buying spree as they move to safe assets to guard against Donald Trump’s tariff policies.</p>
<p>Traders are also preparing for the upcoming Federal Reserve policy meeting set for Wednesday. Although the CME Group FedWatch tool shows a 99% probability that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, markets will be watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting comments for any hints on the future policy direction.</p>
<p>Powell has consistently played down expectations for rate cuts, reinforcing the Fed’s cautious approach and that has hurt the USDX. Recent economic data has pointed to a slowdown in the general economy and that may be a factor in Powell’s latest appearance.</p>
<p>“The broader driver here is uncertainty and risks, downside risks to the US and the global economic outlook, and that is pushing down some of the more procyclical commodities closely tied to US growth, such as oil, but it’s supporting gold,” Struyven said. “We have seen very significant increases in investment demand for gold, and we’re seeing very rapid buying from central banks for gold as well”.</p>
<p>“Our forecast base case for (<strong><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold</a></strong>) year-end is $3,100 per ounce. But we think that the risk to this base case and to our $3,100-$3,300 range are skewed to the upside. It’s pretty remarkable. We have seen a rally despite a decline in speculative positioning. So positioning is a lot cleaner than before the rally”.</p>
<p>The current dynamic could put the USDX on a path to the key 100 support level and it may come with the central bank meeting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US election drama poll swings could affect the price of the greenback going forward. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40320" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="DXY - Daily Chart" width="768" height="600" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart.png 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DXY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DXY</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has bounced from 100.61 which held the market rally through 2024. The dollar will have to hold this level or risk a further correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some confusion in markets may be occurring as polls show Kamala Harris closing the gap in the Presidential race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In overall voting, Harris is said to be leading by Trump, 48%-43%, according to one, which has a margin error of 3.1%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising expectations that former President Trump would regain the White House in November led to a so-called “Trump trade,” which believed his policies would boost corporate profits and alleviate the country’s debt spiral. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some confusion is now creeping into the market as investors are unsure what foreign and domestic policy will look like.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors had been moving into corners of the US equity market that could benefit from Trump policies such as tax cuts and regulatory easing, including small caps and energy shares. That idea also helped to fuel a rotation out of big tech stocks into other areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem in the outlook is the bond market with investors moving out of longer-term bonds as they worry about spending. UK merchant banking firm Close Brothers estimated that a second Trump term could create $4 trillion to $5 trillion of extra government borrowing over 10 years, potentially boosting inflation and hurting bond prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is unlikely that a democratic government will fare better on spending and that may be the reason that the US dollar is possibly looking for a rebound.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With GDP data ahead, the US dollar will likely break from a tight range this week. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32418" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="DXY Dollar Index – Daily Chart" width="1027" height="634" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart.png 1027w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart-1024x632.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1027px) 100vw, 1027px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DXY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar index is highlighting a turning point for the USD, and this week, a breakout or correction should begin.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US economy&#8217;s durable goods orders were released on Wednesday evening, and the market expects an improvement of 2.5% from 1.3%. The following day, the GDP release will be at 8:30 pm HKT, but traders can use the levels provided to play a move outside the recent range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth is expected to slow in the US to 2.5% from 3.4%, which could affect the interest rate path. Some analysts are critical of higher rates for slowing economic growth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar continues to be a headache for Asian central banks, with </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trading at levels close to 155, which could prompt intervention from the Bank of Japan. Markets will also be busy with US earnings this week when companies such as Tesla and Alphabet report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some see the potential for the Federal Reserve to hold rates at higher levels on the interest rate front. New York Fed President John Williams discussed the potential last week for hikes but does not see it soon. Currently, the Fed is seeking a 2% inflation rate, yet recent figures are closer to 3%. That has dampened the market&#8217;s mood for summer rate cuts that could boost economic growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday has an important inflation barometer with the US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report, and it could mark a critical week for the US dollar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerome Powell and other central bank officials have continued to stress the need for patience. This week&#8217;s GDP number could be a vital indicator for traders over the coming weeks. Chicago Fed Reserve President Austan Goolsbee was the latest official to hit higher rates, saying the progress on bringing down inflation has &#8220;stalled&#8221; this year. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-za/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dropped more than 2% to a one-week low after worries over a wider Middle East conflict subsided with no escalation over the weekend.</span></p>
