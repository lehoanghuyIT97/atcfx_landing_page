										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares in </span><b>Super Micro Computer (NYSE:SMCI)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were 5% lower on Tuesday despite some stronger sales data. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41505" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SMCI-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SMCI - Daily Chart" width="918" height="598" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SMCI-Daily-Chart.png 918w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SMCI-Daily-Chart-300x195.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SMCI-Daily-Chart-768x500.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SMCI &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMCI shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rallied to around the $50 level, but have since pulled back to $45.35. This is an important level as a failure to get back above $47.99 would be bearish.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it now ships over 100,000 GPUs per quarter and has delivered more than 2,000 liquid-cooled racks since June 2024. The company’s stock was initially boosted by the news. The company’s advanced cooling technology can manage servers of 12kW of power for AI and high-performance workloads, with a single AI rack now capable of generating over 100 kW of heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquid cooling  has allowed the company to become an important provider of AI hardware, especially as demand outpaces supply at the likes of Nvidia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMCI completed a 10-for-1 stock split recently, which companies often do when their share prices rise and become unappealing to retail investors. After trading near $416 per share, the company now trades in the $40s after the split. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is still a dark cloud surrounding the company after an investigation from the US DoJ (Department of Justice). This came after a report by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, which accused the company of account malpractice and highlighted a rise in sales to Russia, which is a sanctioned country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the company’s report surrounding June chip sales, they will have to provide investors with a solid </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after delaying their recent filing a matter of days after the short seller accusations. The weakness in the stock highlights continued concerns by investors.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of SMCI fell 23% on Friday and may attract value investors. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32419" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SMCI-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SMCI – Daily Chart" width="913" height="619" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SMCI-–-Daily-Chart.png 913w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SMCI-–-Daily-Chart-300x203.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SMCI-–-Daily-Chart-768x521.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SMCI – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMCI has some support at the $700 level and may attract investors looking for a bounce to the $872 resistance level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro&#8217;s management told investors on Friday that the company will release earnings on 30 April. Traders were worried that they did not pre-release the numbers at that time. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been on a big AI-fuelled rally this year and has since given up some gains. There has also been a cooling in other AI-related chipmakers, such as ASML, which is down 11% over the last week following its earnings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some may see it as a buying opportunity before the earnings release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s results for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 saw them beat estimates for revenue and earnings. Net sales doubled to $3.66 billion from $1.80 billion a year ago due to new customer additions. Earnings per share of $5.59 were also up 71.5% year-over-year. They have also beaten EPS estimates in four of the last five quarters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro&#8217;s growth has been driven by its ability to customise its server products according to its customers&#8217; requirements. This gives the company an advantage over some of its competition and helps it time the artificial intelligence hype well. The company has good relations with Silicon Valley manufacturers, giving them an edge. Super Micro&#8217;s specialised servers and storage products are essential to building AI tools like ChatGPT or Google&#8217;s Gemini. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That should keep the company&#8217;s products in demand over the coming years. Despite the recent losses, SMCI is still up by 156% year-to-date.</span></p>
