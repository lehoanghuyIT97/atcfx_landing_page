										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong move for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the weekend has the coin on course for a test of the highs above $109,000. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50348" style="width: 745px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50348" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD – Daily Chart" width="745" height="540" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 745w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50348" class="wp-caption-text">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found strong support with the stock market as it tested the $76,768 level. The coin now looks to push for the $109,000 level this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move to new highs could come easily as talk of the bullish weekend could see </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors rushing to catch the trend. Bitmex founder Arthur Hayes has predicted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million before 2028. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new round of bullish price predictions could see investors trying to join the rally. Hayes believes that capital controls worldwide and US Treasury “devaluation” means that Bitcoin will become a popular safe haven for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of US Treasurys will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volume in this upmove has not been particularly strong and that could provide further fuel for a breakout this week. Credit ratings agency Moodys rattled the US dollar last week with a downgrade for the country’s debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing the debt rating from &#8216;AAA&#8217; to &#8216;Aa1&#8217;, Moody&#8217;s noted that successive US administrations had not done enough to tackle rising deficits and interest costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downgrade &#8220;reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,&#8221; a Moody&#8217;s statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could add to the safe haven theme and bring traders into the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US tech stocks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are around -4% lower from their previous highs and may look to close that gap this week. A move in risk-on assets would be another boost for Bitcoin as it looks to test the all-time highs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank has announced another </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purchase plan despite losing on the token in 2018.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48544" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD – Daily Chart" width="865" height="547" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 865w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x190.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x486.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTCUSD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has rallied this week to sit near $93,700 and a push to $100k Is possible next week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese investment giant SoftBank is testing the crypto waters again with the new bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicle, Twenty One Capital, in conjunction with Tether, Bitfinex, and Cantor Fitzgerald. It is another welcome sign of institutional flows for bulls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Group has $308 billion assets under management and is another sign of a large corporation buying into the world’s largest <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a>. The US tech giant put a vote to its shareholders over the last year to invest in BTC but it was voted down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For other investors, there is a worry that it is a bad omen for crypto after a previous loss. In 2019, SoftBank made headlines when its founder, Masayoshi Son, took a big loss on a personal bitcoin investment. Son had taken exposure to cryptocurrency in late 2017, when the ICO mania was peaking and bitcoin was trading at an all-time high of around $20,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With bitcoin now trading at $93,000, Son’s investment would have been very profitable had he held it. But he sold in early 2018 as bitcoin began to crash, resulting in a $130 million loss, according to the WSJ. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains to be seen how Son will do this time around but the move can help some short-term gains in Bitcoin after the coin has rallied from a recent correction. Some safe haven flows have arrived after ETF flows have been reduced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new TwentyOne investment vehicle has already placed $4bn of BTC on its balance sheet and looks set to add more in the coming months. A pause in tariffs could see less market volatility and a return to speculative investments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>BTC slipped to $82,500 ahead of Tuesday’s session and could look to retest the $78250 support. The post-election rally starred at $67,668 and that can be the next target.</p>
<p>BlackRock management believes that he U.S. dollar could lose its status as the world’s reserve currency to Bitcoin or other digital assets if the United States does not get its debt under control.</p>
<p>Chairman Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter to Investors that “decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation” that makes “markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent”. But “that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar”.</p>
<p>The U.S. debt equaled 122.3% of the country’s gross domestic product in 2023, which was higher than the 105% seen in 2018.</p>
<p>If every asset ends up being tokenized, Fink said, “it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth”.</p>
<p>That forward-looking assessment is not helping the price of BTC in the short-term as the price has struggled in 2025.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s strategic reserve has disappointed investors as it will only hold BTC that was recovered by Federal investigators. Coins such as Solana and XRP may fare better with outright purchases later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s tariffs</a> were set to come into effect on Wednesday 2 April but they have already rocked markets and it remains to be seen if the global economy will suffer in coming months. A reduction in economic activity could weaken the appetite for tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.</p>
