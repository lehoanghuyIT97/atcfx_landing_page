<figure id="attachment_50445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50445" style="width: 834px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50445" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="USDJPY – Daily Chart" width="834" height="525" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 834w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x189.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x483.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50445" class="wp-caption-text">USDJPY – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD v JPY has been retreating again with a move to 144.30  and it is possible that the pair could move lower toward 142. The September low at 139.63 would be the bigger test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan’s bond market sentiment was hurt by the worst auction demand since 2012. The sale comes after a recent surge in longer-dated Japanese bond yields and increased volatility, partly due to the recent US policy measures. Investors were worried that the central bank was stepping back from the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan has been the biggest buyer of US treasury bonds with official data showing holdings of $1.13 trillion in March. Any problems in the Japanese economy could ultimately backfire on the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was gloomy about the fiscal situation, saying: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our country’s fiscal situation is undoubtedly extremely poor, worse than Greece’s”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan reported last week that its GDP growth shrank in the past quarter, with investors fearing a recession. On Monday, the cost of borrowing rose after yields on the 40-year bond hit highs not seen in 20 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ishiba was elected prime minister after pitching himself as a hawk aiming to curb the excesses of “Abenomics”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the US debt downgrade, the USD v JPY could be a currency to watch over the coming months as capital flows could change. For the moment, the yen may drop to test the lows of last September.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Monetary Fund expects the Bank of Japan to delay any imminent rate hikes due to tariffs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48438" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDJPY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USDJPY - Daily Chart" width="751" height="568" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDJPY-Daily-Chart.png 751w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDJPY-Daily-Chart-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">USDJPY &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDJPY</a> has found some support near the 2024 lows after safe haven flows had boosted the yen. The lack of imminent hikes could see the dollar find further buyers.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan is likely to push back the timing of further rate hikes as tariff uncertainty has increased the downside risks to growth and inflation in Japan, a senior International Monetary Fund official said.</p>
<p>The IMF was delivering its latest outlook for global economic growth in the major economies. The IMF still expects inflation will return to the BOJ&#8217;s 2% target, though that will happen in 2027 rather than in 2026, according to the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of companies are likely now on the fence, not carrying out their investment plans and waiting for clarity on what&#8217;s going to happen. This is postponing investment decisions as well,&#8221; Nada Choueiri said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do see that if our reference scenario materializes, the BOJ interest rate increases will be pushed backwards in time&#8221;. Under a scenario where growth is dampened, the accommodation may need to be sustained for longer&#8221;.</p>
<p>Analysts in April said they expected the BOJ would hold rates steady through June, with a 25-basis-point hike expected next quarter among a slight majority of respondents.</p>
<p>In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said it expects Japan&#8217;s economy to expand 0.6% in 2025, -0.5% from January. It also expects growth of 0.6% in 2026, down -0.20% from January.</p>
<p>&#8220;The balance of risks is on the downside for growth and for inflation,&#8221; due to global uncertainty caused by higher US tariffs. That could lead to a drop in consumption and discourage firms from larger pay hikes in next year&#8217;s wage talks, Choueiri added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next two days will bring interest rate decisions and central bank conferences from the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47001" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USDJPY – Daily Chart" width="757" height="582" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 757w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x231.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sits at an important level that created an August high and November support. A move lower or higher could mark a medium-term trend move. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese interest rate decision comes on Wednesday with a press conference at 2:30pm HKT. The US Federal Reserve has its own interest rate meeting release at 2am, with a press conference to follow and the USD v JPY may have a defined trend into the end of the week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders expect the BoJ to pause its rate-hiking cycle this month after it raised its policy rate to 0.50%, the highest in 17 years, as Japan continues to target a 2% inflation target. Despite growing trade war and economic slowdown fears, Governor Kazuo Ueda and his colleagues continued to hint at further rate hikes if inflation does get to 2%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan’s inflation is at its highest level since January 2023 with Consumer Price figures at 4% in January and core inflation, without food and energy, rising to 2.5% from 2.4% in the month before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Long-term interest rates move on various factors. But the biggest determinant is the market’s forecast on the outlook for our short-term policy rate,&#8221; Ueda said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold and the press conference may have some interesting comments on the recent trade moves and the downturn in the US dollar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump has been critical of the Fed Chair in previous months and may react to any criticism from the central bank. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump have said that there will be a short-term upset in the economy, but the US would bounce back to strength after the market settles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next few days could see the USDJPY making a move beyond the 149.50 level and extending a move.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the USDJPY is testing support at the 149 level and a failure there could lead to further losses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders are betting that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will continue raising interest rates this year in the wake of higher inflation in Japan. Data released last week showed that Japan&#8217;s core inflation touched a 19-month high in January. Additionally, the Services Producer Price Index (PPI) from Japan underlined the view that rising wages are persuading firms to pass on higher costs to customers. Hawkish BoJ expectations are also helping to power the Japanese yen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the USD side, markets fear that President Trump is going to sour a recession by slashing Federal worker levels and cutting spending with its efficiency drive. Overall, 75,000 federal workers accepted a resignation package and will be added to the next payrolls data. His administration also began the process of firing probationary federal employees across the country, with around 220,000 federal employees in the firing line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total of these two groups would mark around 300,000 workers, amounting to the “largest job cut in American history (by a mile),” according to Callie Cox, chief strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese yen is also used as a safe haven in uncertain times and that is spurring demand in a time of heavy political and economic uncertainty. Trades should be cautious with many speculative assets testing support levels and Nvidia earnings after the US market closes on Wednesday is a high-risk event that could make or break the market.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese yen surged to an eight-week peak against the US dollar on Thursday, driven by a Bank of Japan (BOJ) policymaker’s endorsement of further interest rate increases to address inflationary pressures. This rally contrasted sharply with the British pound’s downturn after the Bank of England (BoE) lowered interest rates as anticipated, though its warnings of elevated inflation and sluggish growth—paired with two officials pushing for a steeper cut—dragged the currency 0.8% lower to $1.24065. The pound had previously touched a one-month high of $1.2437 on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the BoE’s move, financial markets now price in roughly 67 basis points of additional monetary easing by year-end. Analysts suggest the pound’s decline may be tempered by the UK’s services-dominated economy, which faces fewer risks from global trade tensions. Meanwhile, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dollar index</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> edged up to 107.92, hovering near its lowest level since early last week as optimism grew over easing trade war fears. The index has fallen 2% from its January 13 two-year high of 110.17, partly influenced by the US suspending tariffs on Mexico and Canada while imposing new 10% duties on Chinese goods. Investors await Friday’s US jobs report for clues on future monetary policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Japan, the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> weakened to 151.81 per dollar, its lowest since December 12, after BOJ board member Naoki Tamura advocated for gradual rate hikes to counter inflation. It later pared gains slightly to 151.85. Tamura’s remarks bolstered expectations of a 25-basis-point BOJ rate increase by September. In contrast, markets fully price in a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in July, with cumulative reductions of 46 basis points projected by December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, the offshore yuan dipped modestly, while the Canadian dollar hit a December 17 high before stabilizing at C$1.43405 against the greenback. The euro slipped 0.36% to $1.0363, reflecting broader currency market adjustments.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45274" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USDJPY – Daily Chart" width="867" height="535" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 867w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDJPY has three important levels ahead of the BOJ decision. The recent highs around the 156.75-158 level are a pivot with the 150 marking the downside support and the larger upside at 161.82. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no official time for the interest rate decision but it is suggested to be after 10am HKT with the BOJ Q4 outlook at 11am and the press conference set for 14:30pm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Japan is expected to raise rates this week with markets calm following the inauguration of Donald Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The BOJ has sent out a clear message that a rate hike will be on the table, so I think the possibility of raising rates is quite high,” said Masahiro Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a recent Bloomberg survey, more than 70% of economists expected the central bank to raise its short-term policy rate from 0.25%. Others expect a move in March from the BOJ. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outlook for Japan has been clouded by questions around the first days of the Trump administration, with the fear of aggressive tariffs. That could hurt the export-dependent Japanese companies. The BOJ left rates unchanged because it wanted to wait and see how Trump would affect markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The outlook for the global economy, especially the US, remains vague, while the economic policies of the next US administration are still largely uncertain,&#8221; Governor Kazuo Ueda said after the previous meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BOJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino said last week that the bank will decide after looking at the big picture but admitted that the US economy is “one major factor”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BOJ move may be anticipated this week with the potential for no increase on tariff fears. That could lead to USD strength but a rate increase could boost the JPY. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar was weaker after the Davos appearance of Donald Trump who reiterated tariff threats and a desire for lower </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jobless claims were little changed this week and helped to keep the dollar strong.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDJPY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the USDJPY is now back above the 157.59 level and that is above the previous selling in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m deeply concerned about recent currency moves, including those driven by speculators,” Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The government will take appropriate action against excessive FX moves,” Kato added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In terms of whether there will actually be an intervention, the sense of tension is likely to increase as the yen approaches 160,” said Takeshi Ishida at Kansai Mirai Bank. “If they intervened in an environment of low liquidity the yen strengthening move could be bigger”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The yen experienced a sharp move lower after the BOJ’ stood still on rates and Governor Ueda’s comments indicated the possibility of a later-than-expected rate hike in March or later. With Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinting at a hawkish stance on rates, traders expect a continued disconnect between US and Japanese rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It may not work if they intervene right now, as there’s also dollar strength so there’s a risk it could have an unwanted impact,” said Tohru Sasaki at Fukuoka Financial. “They would likely hold off on intervention until it passes the 161 level since that’s around where they moved last time”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders would be taking a risk if they went long the USD at the current level up to the 161 figure. There is also some concern around potential </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump tariffs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January. Any tariffs imposed on China could hurt the Asian economies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has an important Speaker vote on Friday, which could mean his vote cannot be certified as standard on January 6 if current Speaker Mike Johnson loses only two votes from Republicans.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44255" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USDJPY – Daily Chart" width="823" height="598" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 823w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x218.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x558.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDJPY – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of USD v JPY has moved above the 156.73 level and that brings the pair back into the view of the BOJ. After two interventions this year, traders have a short memory and longs would be risky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data begins on Friday at 7:30am HKT for the Japanese economy with CPI consumer inflation figures. Markets will be looking for any deviation on last month’s 2.6% figure, which was 2.2% in the expected food and energy reading. Anything higher could speed up the Bank of Japan’s plan for a rate increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unemployment data is expected to come in at 7:50am with analysts expecting the 2.5% reading to remain. Industrial production is released alongside that with an expectation for a -3.4% reading after a positive 2.8% in the previous month. That number could be focused on by traders if it shows weakness in factories. However, the government has predicted that industrial output will return to full capacity in the next fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest move higher in the US currency, the pair is once again treading on dangerous ground. The BOJ intervened in the market back in May leading to a sharp sell-off. The bounce into November led to a pullback and traders are bidding the USD up to levels that will not please the central bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest update, the government also said that Japan&#8217;s economy is expected to grow 1.2% in fiscal 2025, which starts in April. That is unchanged from its previous November forecast. The government maintained its view that personal consumption will remain strong due to higher wage growth and stable inflation, while exports are expected to improve due to a moderate pickup in overseas economies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government expects personal consumption, which accounts for half of the country&#8217;s GDP growth, to grow 1.3%, or an increase of 0.1 percentage point from the previous estimate. Inflation is expected to be anchored at the 2% target level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fiscal 2024, the government lowered its economic growth outlook to 0.4% from 0.7%, which was driven by lower vehicle production and China&#8217;s slowing growth. Weakness in the auto sector has led to a planned merger between car giants Nissan and Honda.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDJPY &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of USDJPY has rallied to 156 but fell back toward the 150 level. Some negative data for the USD could test the 140 level again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese GDP growth data comes out at 7:50am HKT on Monday. Analysts are expecting to see a 0.2% print from Japan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data follows a big week for US data where manufacturing was stronger and the NFP payrolls job data came in strong. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) in the US rose by 227,000 during November, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Friday. This reading followed the 36,000 increase reported in October, which was revised up from 12,000 and came in above the market expectation of 200,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other details in the report highlighted that the Unemployment Rate rose to 4.2% in November from 4.1%, as expected. The Labor Force Participation Rate edged lower to 62.5% during the period, while the annual wage inflation, measured by the change in the Average Hourly Earnings, held steady at 4%, coming in above the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Japan, the government held its belief that the economy is recovering moderately on Tuesday, while warning about the potential impact of US President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s policies on the economic outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Trends in the US economy can have a direct or indirect impact on the Japanese economy, and we also need to be aware of the possibility of an impact through fluctuations in financial and capital markets,&#8221; a Cabinet Office official said after the release of the monthly economic report for November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the potential for investment flows coming in from South Korea, where the President was under threat of treason. Tokyo is about to introduce a four-day workweek for government employees, in an attempt to help working mothers and boost the country’s record-low fertility rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will review work styles … with flexibility, ensuring no one has to give up their career due to life events such as childbirth or childcare,” said Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike. It is unsure how the measure will affect consumer spending of GDP in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the USA, it is a waiting game ahead of the Trump Presidency as the incoming President will have power to affect policy.</span></p>

<p>The Bank of Japan held rates steady last week, leading to a bounce in the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-za/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDJPY</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">USDJPY &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The USDJPY exchange rate has bounced from previous support at 140.23, which marks the lowest level coming into 2024. The price of USDJPY now has an obstacle at 146.47.</p>
<p>The US dollar has been sliding recently due to the unwinding of interest rates from the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan held its interest rates steady and revised its consumption assessment, suggesting further confidence in a solid economic recovery. That could allow the bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months.</p>
<p>The BOJ held short-term interest rates steady at 0.25% as expected while noting improved domestic conditions, which continue to hint at an unwinding of years of loose monetary policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Private consumption has been on a moderate increasing trend despite the impact of price rises and other factors,&#8221; the BOJ statement said. The assessment was more optimistic than previous statements and noted that consumption was resilient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our decision on monetary policy will depend on economic, price and financial developments at the time,&#8221; Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Japan&#8217;s real interest rates remain extremely low. If our economic and price forecasts are achieved, we will raise interest rates and adjust the degree of monetary support accordingly,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The dollar bounced despite the Fed&#8217;s rate cut and will look to find a bottom at the current lows. The US central bank has hinted at 50 bps of further cuts this year and more in 2025. However, the lack of action by the BOJ to move higher in its rate cycle has allowed some strength to return to the US dollar. Markets will now shift their focus to economic data to see if it backs up the BOJ and Fed assessments.</p>
