<p><em>Hi Ahmad, thanks for joining us today. In June 2022, ATFX announced its entry into the LEVANT region by partnering with Amman-based investment firm Emerging Markets in Jordan. The collaboration marks a significant milestone as ATFX is the only Global broker who is present in the LEVANT region. What were the main challenges ATFX Levant faced in the past two years, and how were they overcome?</em></p>

<p><em>Ahmad Al Disi:</em></p>
<p>ATFX faced some significant challenges in entering and establishing itself in the LEVANT region</p>
<ol>
<li>Regulatory Changes: The regulatory environment in the FX industry underwent a major overhaul in 2017 with the Jordan Securities Commission Authority implementing stricter rules and regulations. This shift likely presented challenges for ATFX, especially as they were entering a market that was previously unregulated. To overcome this, ATFX adapted quickly to comply with the new regulations, as it operates globally and have well-respected licenses from around the globe, which made the regulators happy to work with a global company and not a regional company that is sub-branching.</li>
<li>Competitive Landscape: Being a late entrant to the market (starting 5 years after competitors), ATFX faced strong competition from existing players who had already established their presence in the region. Overcoming this challenge involved strategic positioning, offering unique value propositions, and building strong partnerships, as seen with their collaboration with Emerging Markets.</li>
<li>Establishing Trust and Credibility: As a relatively new player in a market with established competitors, building trust and credibility have been crucial. This has been achieved through transparent practices, superior customer service, and demonstrating commitment to compliance and regulatory standards.</li>
<li>Cultural and Operational Adaptation: Entering a new market often requires understanding and adapting to local culture, business practices, and customer preferences. ATFX invested in local talent, language capabilities, and customized services to effectively serve the LEVANT region.</li>
<li>Infrastructure and Network Development: Setting up regional offices and expanding operations to service the LEVANT region required substantial investments in infrastructure, technology, and network development. Overcoming logistical challenges and ensuring seamless operations have been key to our success.</li>
</ol>

<p>ATFX Levant has ambitious plans for the upcoming year, focusing on strategic initiatives and expansions:</p>
<p>Expansion into Iraq with Ashur Bank Partnership: Through its partnership with Ashur Bank, ATFX secured central bank approval to offer its services in Iraq. This initiative marks a significant milestone as ATFX will establish a local presence in Iraq, becoming one of the first brokers to receive such approval. This expansion into Iraq underscores ATFX&#8217;s commitment to reaching new markets and catering to a broader client base.</p>
<p>Expansion into Lebanon: ATFX Levant is also planning to expand its operations into Lebanon. This move signifies a strategic expansion into another key market within the LEVANT region. By establishing a physical presence in Lebanon, ATFX aims to strengthen its regional footprint and further enhance its service offerings to clients in the area.</p>
