										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese EV shares dropped this week after BYD, a leading EV manufacturer, increased fears of a tough price war. The company&#8217;s aggressive price cuts have been rattling the sector, adding to fears over profitability and competition. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50725" style="width: 729px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50725" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NIO – Daily Chart" width="729" height="529" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart.png 729w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50725" class="wp-caption-text">NIO – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIO (NYSE:NIO) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were lower on the news with a move from the $4 level to prices under $3.80. This is a key level for the stock as a failure could move further down toward the $3 lows of April. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of Geely, Li Auto, and Xpeng saw declines of 7%, 5%, and 4% respectively, after BYD announced significant price reductions on 22 models, including the entry-level Seagull EV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price cuts are a strategic move by BYD to maintain its market leadership,&#8221; said analysts at Financial Times. &#8220;However, this aggressive pricing strategy could lead to a prolonged price war, affecting the entire industry&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a clear indication that the price war in the Chinese EV market is heating up,&#8221; said an analyst from South China Morning Post. &#8220;BYD&#8217;s move is likely to force other manufacturers to follow suit, leading to a potential race to the bottom&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price war raises concerns about the profitability of rival Chinese EV manufacturers, especially those that are targeted at higher-end consumers, such as NIO. BYD&#8217;s latest profit forecast fell short of analyst’s expectations, highlighting the challenges created by the intense competition in electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent setback, BYD was optimistic about its long-term prospects. In a statement released after the earnings, the company emphasized its commitment to innovation and market leadership. The latest price cuts by BYD may also be an effort to hit Tesla while it has already been struggling.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price war could lead to a shakeout in the Chinese EV market,&#8221; said an analyst from NBC Los Angeles. &#8220;Only the most competitive and innovative companies will be able to withstand the pressure&#8221;.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia (NAS100:NVDA) is worth looking at again this week ahead of an important <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q1 earnings</a> call.</p>
<figure id="attachment_50726" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50726" style="width: 826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-50726 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NVDA – Daily Chart" width="826" height="534" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart.png 826w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-768x497.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50726" class="wp-caption-text">NVDA – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>The price of NVDA is trading at $131.29 on a quiet trading day after the Memorial holiday in the US. The earnings call comes with two overhead levels in play. If analysts are disappointed, then a correction could come. Either of those events is likely to make-or-break the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stock market’s</a> rebound from April.</p>
<p>Nvidia investors will be looking for real answers from management on how much US chip curbs on China exports will cost the company when it reports on Wednesday. A recent pullback in other regulations may also open up new markets.</p>
<p>In a fresh effort to stop Beijing&#8217;s access to cutting-edge technology, the Trump administration added export limits to Nvidia&#8217;s H20 chip. The company announced that a $5.5 billion impairment charge would be expected.</p>
<p>Nvidia does not break down its sales for the H20 chip, the only product it was allowed to sell to China, which accounted for 13% of its revenue last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary question around results and guidance is can Nvidia lift sales enough to offset the loss of H20 or China business,&#8221; Wedbush analysts said this week.</p>
<p>The company posted a very positive first quarter of Blackwell sales in its last earnings release and it may be a boost for the company if those sales can cover the China loss.</p>
<p>CEO Jensen Huang recently criticised the country’s wider export controls as a “failure”, saying they had backfired by spurring on Chinese developers. He also sought to soothe investor concerns about Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, which developed a lower-cost rival.</p>
<p>“Trump’s tariffs and trade policies are blotting out many other issues right now, but this one is yet to go away,” AJ Bell analysts said.</p>
<p>“The DeepSeek product challenged the consensus view that AI required more – more chipsets, more computing and server power, and more energy – and AI-related stocks have yet to fully recover their poise. Nvidia did offer fairly cautious guidance for the first quarter, which runs from February to April, but it has had the happy knack of beating estimates for the quarter,” they added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fell over 0.50% on Monday due to decreased safe-haven demand after US President Trump delayed EU tariffs. Low trading volumes persisted with UK and US markets closed. XAU/USD is at $3,336. Market sentiment improved after Trump&#8217;s Sunday tariff postponement until July 9, causing downward pressure on gold after a 4.86% weekly gain (largest since April 7).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, XAU/USD bullish trend continued as Trump pressured Apple to manufacture in the US (threatening 25% tariffs) and suggested potential 50% EU tariffs, driving gold from $3,287 to $3,365. Despite the recent pullback, gold is expected to rise. China&#8217;s net gold imports via Hong Kong significantly increased in April. Geopolitical tensions remain due to Russia&#8217;s continued attacks on Ukraine, met with a strong reaction from Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&#8217;s US economic data includes April Durable Goods Orders, FOMC minutes, Q1 2025 GDP (second estimate), and the Core PCE Price Index.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downward Pressure on Gold Despite Economic Concerns</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices experienced downward pressure despite stable US Treasury yields and a decline in real yields. While concerns regarding US fiscal policy, including Moody&#8217;s recent credit rating downgrade and a significant increase in the debt ceiling, presented a potentially supportive backdrop, increased risk appetite among investors weighed on the precious metal&#8217;s valuation. A marginal depreciation of the US Dollar Index (DXY) to 99 provided limited countervailing support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAU/USD Technical Outlook</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices slightly retreated as traders took profits amid low US liquidity due to a holiday. Trump&#8217;s trade policy uncertainty may cause volatility to resume. Technically, gold&#8217;s bull trend holds. A daily close above $3,300 could lead to testing $3,365, then $3,400, the $3,438 May 7 high, and the $3,500 ATH. Conversely, falling below $3,300 may trigger a move to the $3,204 May 20 low and the $3,199 50-day SMA.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailer </span><b>PDD Holdings (NAS100:PDD)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> releases first quarter </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday with the stock trying to reclaim the 2025 highs. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50576" style="width: 754px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50576" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PDD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="PDD - Daily Chart" width="754" height="502" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PDD-Daily-Chart.png 754w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PDD-Daily-Chart-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50576" class="wp-caption-text">PDD &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PDD shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trades at $119.24 with the 2025 highs set at the $133.34 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PDD’s first-quarter earnings report could serve as the next big driver for its share price, Morgan Stanley analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retailer is set to release its financial results on Tuesday morning and the investment bank sees potential upside depending on the strength of its online marketing services (OMS) revenue and profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe its 1Q25 OMS revenue growth and non-GAAP net profit could be the next share price catalyst,” analysts wrote. Morgan Stanley expects OMS revenue to rise 11% year over year, marking an 18% growth in gross merchandise volume (GMV), and non-GAAP net profit to hit 28 billion yuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts also see the company continuing to gain market share in the domestic market, forecasting GMV growth that outpaces the broader industry’s 6% expansion. However, they added that OMS revenue is likely to grow at a slower rate than GMV, as the company increases subsidies to merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley outlines three potential scenarios for the quarter, with a base case, which it assigns a 60% probability, is for OMS revenue growth of 11–14% and profit of 27–28 billion yuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more bullish outcome would be stronger revenue growth and profit of up to 30 billion yuan, which could boost the share price by 5–15%. However, weaker numbers than these scenarios could see the stock down more than 10%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite paying larger subsidies to merchants and consumers, Morgan Stanley believes some of the pressure could be “partially offset by less spending in Temu US”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2025 price high could come into play this week for PDD stock.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle maker </span><b>Li Auto (NAS100:LI)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> releases </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week with the stock hovering below recent highs. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50575" style="width: 916px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50575" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LI-Daily-Chart.png" alt="LI - Daily Chart" width="916" height="541" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LI-Daily-Chart.png 916w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LI-Daily-Chart-300x177.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LI-Daily-Chart-768x454.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50575" class="wp-caption-text">LI &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of LI is trading at $28.91 and the resistance ahead is the 2024 high at $41.08. Just above that level we have the 2025 high around $33. These are the key obstacles for the current bullish activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Auto is releasing its first quarter results on Thursday after the stock has jumped by more than 50% from its 2025 lows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect the latest results to show that Li Auto’s revenue dropped slightly in the first quarter to CNY 25 billion, with earnings per share expected to fall from CNY 1.21 to CNY 0.64.  Li Auto is then expected to continue its growth trajectory, with analysts expecting annual revenue at the firm to be CNY 169 billion, up by 17.2% from last year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent reports showed that deliveries are still growing, with 33,939 vehicles dispatched in April, up by 31% from the same period last year. The figure is also above the March deliveries of 36,674.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts are majorly bullish on the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Auto stock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price, with an average target of $33.77, up from the current $28.9. With Tesla floundering across the globe, positive earnings results could see further investment interest flowing to Li stock. A breach of the $133 resistance level could get up to $150 if the general market remains positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research firm Rho Motion predicts that China’s subsidies and the new EU emissions targets will see global EV and plug-in hybrid sales to increase by more than 17% in 2025, reaching 20 million units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the US market, a lot of uncertainty has obviously hit the market in the last year or so, and we are expecting reduced EV forecasts, However, the shift to electric vehicles is still very much happening, and we will still see growth over the next decade,” a Rho report said.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_50541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50541" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50541" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPJPY – Daily Chart" width="990" height="589" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 990w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x178.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x457.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50541" class="wp-caption-text">GBPJPY – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBP v JPY has resistance at the 194.71 level which has been an obstacle for the pair in January and April. Another failure at that failure could see a correction in the pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British retail sales numbers are released on Friday at 2pm HKT with economists expecting to see a monthly dip of 0.4% to 0.2%. However, the yearly figure is expected to show an increase from 2.6% to 4.5%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound was trading close to its highest level against the US dollar since 2022 as hotter inflation and improving relations with Europe and the US continued to support the currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The trade deals are generally good news for the pound,&#8221; said ING FX strategist Francesco Pesole. &#8220;We still think the pound is in a pretty good position&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest inflation readings could also stall any future rate cuts from the Bank of England and support the pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BoE&#8217;s chief economist Huw Pill said this week that a quarterly pace of cuts was &#8220;too rapid&#8221; given still strong wage pressures on inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of dissent building at the Bank of England,&#8221; ING&#8217;s Pesole added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country’s central bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25% on May 8 in a three-way split vote, with two members favouring a bigger cut, and two &#8211; including Pill – deciding a hold was the best option. The recent positive sentiment should continue to boost the prospects for the British pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Japan&#8217;s government downgraded its assessment of the global economy on Thursday due to the uncertainty over trade policy. In its monthly economic report for May, the government lowered its outlook for the US economy for the first time in nearly three years to say its expansion was moderating.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">German stock market (GER 30)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has continued its strong recovery and has hit new highs. However, some slowing momentum in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/mt4-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MACD indicator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a warning. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50542" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50542" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GER 30 – Daily Chart" width="640" height="651" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart.png 640w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart-295x300.png 295w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50542" class="wp-caption-text">GER 30 – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the GER 30 now trades at 24,040 after a slump to as low as 19,000 in April. The push to new highs has occurred alongside a declining MACD indicator which would raise caution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The German stock market continues to move strongly despite a weak economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent data showed German wage growth has eased significantly, and economic weakness suggests future bonuses will likely be much lower than in the past, according to the Bundesbank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-quarter negotiated wages rose just 0.9% from a year ago, compared to a 5.8% gain at the end of 2024, according to the central bank’s report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany’s economy is expected to stagnate this year as the country faces headwinds from  Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade threats, the government’s panel of economic advisers said Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany has Europe’s largest economy, but hasn’t seen significant economic growth in five years, and gross domestic product shrank in each of the last two years. The panel, in its first forecast since new Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office earlier this month, predicted the economy will stagnate before 1% growth in 2026. A previous forecast in November predicted 0.4% growth this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new outlook is similar to the forecast made a month ago by Germany’s former government. Merz, who took office on May 6, has announced plans to cut bureaucracy, advance digitization, provide tax breaks for companies and promote more free trade agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump’s tariff policy is increasing uncertainty and endangering economic growth worldwide,” said Monika Schnitzer, the head of the panel. But she added that a huge investment package offered by Merz’s coalition “offers opportunities for a modernization of infrastructure in Germany and a return to a higher path of growth”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders can still find some dip buying momentum in the GER 30 but should be wary of any change in sentiment from news headlines that could create another pullback.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_50490" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50490" style="width: 787px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-50490 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NVDA - Daily Chart" width="787" height="510" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Daily-Chart.png 787w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Daily-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Daily-Chart-768x498.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50490" class="wp-caption-text">NVDA &#8211; Daily Chart </figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rebound in NVDA stock saw an important clearing of the downtrend resistance at around $115. The earnings will be a test for the $143.37 level with the all-time highs ahead at $152.84. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia releases earnings in just under a week on May 28 and the stock will be the hottest topic in markets next week. The stock has recovered from an April slump and is now trying to push back to the previous highs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coming earnings could be a significant event that creates the next medium-term trend for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things to consider is a soothing of geopolitical worries on trade. The US and China have pulled back from its trade war and that can create an easier climate. Nvidia has also been moving to invest in manufacturing plants in the United States which can get the company on good terms with the current President and lessen its exposure to overseas issues. A recent trade visit between President Trump and Saudi Arabia has also led to partnership plans with Nvidia and the Middle Eastern state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, would be a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. The growth driver has been higher demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia was very bullish on its early sales of the new Blackwell AI platform. That could be a factor in an earnings surprise this quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors will also focus on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding trade policies and tariffs. The Trump administration has been said to be considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules. That could be another cap to Nvidia’s potential sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remains positive, NVDA could creep toward the first resistance line noted ahead of earnings and set up a retest of the highs with a positive earnings surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR v GBP has slumped from 0.87 in April to 0.84 and is at risk of further losses with a weak bounce. The support level below is the 0.8323 figure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s data starts at 3:30pm HKT with the release of PMI figures for Germany. A move from 48.4 to 48.9 is expected in manufacturing, with a 0.5 increase expected in services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same figures are released for the wider eurozone at 4pm, with gains expected in manufacturing. That will be followed by the UK data at 4:30pm, where a larger jump is expected in its PMI figures. That could show underlying strength in the UK economy and add to recent euro losses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK has recently been in talks with the eurozone on a Brexit reset deal. According to reports, the UK will be granted access to the EU’s £150 billion defence procurement scheme, while checks on food and agricultural equipment at the border are in line for a substantial reduction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics are calling it a ‘surrender deal,’ but financial analysis from Frontier Economics, who assessed how closer ties benefit the domestic economy earlier this year, say that the deal could be worth up to £25 billion annually for the UK. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain&#8217;s economy is expected to grow a little faster this year after a Reuters poll of economists, who see unexpectedly strong growth in the first quarter continuing. Sentiment has improved with the EU deal and a basic trade deal with the United States, which still leaves a 10% tariff on British goods but lowers duties on cars and steel.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The UK government is massively increasing spending this year. There&#8217;s a lot of money coming in and that&#8217;s going to act as a bit of a tailwind as well. Real wage growth is also still quite strong, so the economy still has some reasonable underpinnings&#8221;, said James Smith, economist at ING. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK economy seems to have more positive near-term sentiment than its European counterpart and that can boost the British pound, with PMI figures giving a chance to add further gains. </span></p>
