<p style="text-align: center;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>BTC slipped to $82,500 ahead of Tuesday’s session and could look to retest the $78250 support. The post-election rally starred at $67,668 and that can be the next target.</p>
<p>BlackRock management believes that he U.S. dollar could lose its status as the world’s reserve currency to Bitcoin or other digital assets if the United States does not get its debt under control.</p>
<p>Chairman Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter to Investors that “decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation” that makes “markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent”. But “that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar”.</p>
<p>The U.S. debt equaled 122.3% of the country’s gross domestic product in 2023, which was higher than the 105% seen in 2018.</p>
<p>If every asset ends up being tokenized, Fink said, “it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth”.</p>
<p>That forward-looking assessment is not helping the price of BTC in the short-term as the price has struggled in 2025.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s strategic reserve has disappointed investors as it will only hold BTC that was recovered by Federal investigators. Coins such as Solana and XRP may fare better with outright purchases later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s tariffs</a> were set to come into effect on Wednesday 2 April but they have already rocked markets and it remains to be seen if the global economy will suffer in coming months. A reduction in economic activity could weaken the appetite for tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Whether traders and investors actually have any exposure to the Bitcoin price or not, it would appear that the price of this digital asset has captured the imagination. The Bitcoin price has become a byword for volatility, conspiracy and even scam. Part of the explanation is down to the history of this market, and part to the financial function this asset is supposed to be offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">With the Bitcoin price, the young pretender to Gold, and fiat currency, you run the risk of offending plenty of established interests. It is also the case that with any new technology there tends to be a battle between the early adopters and the mainstream.</span></p>

<p><span id="more-10525"></span></p>
<h2>Bitcoin price breakthrough &#8211; Paypal</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">One of the aspects that has hindered the mass adoption of Bitcoin has been that lack of a common platform to use it on. It needed a Paypal type platform, one which is near universal, and in October it got precisely that. The US payments giant allows both spending in Bitcoin and leading cryptocurrencies, as well as conversion to paper currencies. This acceptance by a Silicon Valley giant is what the Bitcoin price has undoubtedly been waiting for, and the sharp 25% rise from $1,200 to $1,600 in the past few weeks underlines the importance of this move into everyday life for the digital currency concept.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Bitcoin price approaches all time highs<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The story of the Bitcoin price in terms of the meteoric rise from 10 cents a decade ago, to over $20,000 in 2017 is the stuff of legend. Equally so perhaps has been the decline from those peaks three years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The floor in December 2018, almost exactly a year after the record high, was $3,122. Clearly, if the US dollar or the British pound lost 80% plus of their value in a year, their status as leading currencies would be in doubt. The question now is whether in the wake of Paypal giving Bitcoin a solid international tech platform, the volatility will subside and the credibility will surge.</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">1. Register for an account or log in to your existing account</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">2. Open MT4 either on your desktop or mobile</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">3. Search for the cryptocurrency in the market watch or symbols window</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">4. Choose your position size</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">5. Hit buy or sell, and then confirm the trade<br /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The threat to cryptocurrency</h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">For traders it is Bitcoin Gold, and the Bitcoin gold price, which is perhaps of most interest. However, for the financial establishment such as politicians, banks and central banks, if Bitcoin wins, they lose. A currency that sees no borders and no regulatory rules cannot be controlled and perhaps worst of all, cannot be taxed with ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Ironically, it may be a case of “if you can’t beat them, join them.” If, as it would appear, the ECB or the Federal Reserve make moves to deliver a digital euro or dollar, then this could be a threat to the existing cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">This ties in with billionaire investor Ray Dallio’s latest comments that Governments would ban BTC if it became too successful. The Paypal initiative, which could bring Bitcoin that success, could turn out to be a mixed blessing. This is especially if we see digital versions of fiat currencies any time soon.</span></p>
