<p style="text-align: center;">CH 50 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China 50 index</a> surged to 12,316 on Tuesday, taking out four levels of resistance that were previously identified. The current level is the obstacle to further gains, with the May highs near 13,000 now in sight.</p>
<p>China unveiled its largest set of economic stimulus measures since the pandemic as it attempts to kickstart growth in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China said it had cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points and the amount banks must hold as cash reserves, known as reserve requirement ratios, by 20 basis points.</p>
<p>PBoC governor Pan Gongsheng said the measures should &#8220;support the stable growth of China&#8217;s economy&#8221; and &#8220;promote a moderate rebound in prices&#8221;.</p>
<p>Economists have been doubting the government&#8217;s 5% annual growth target as the economy battles <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/deflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deflation</a> and weak demand. Some economists are also unsure whether the latest measures would sufficiently address China&#8217;s broader economic problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a step in the right direction,&#8221; Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China Economics at Capital Economics said. &#8220;But it will probably be insufficient to drive a turnaround in growth unless followed up with greater fiscal support&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lynn Song, chief economist for China at ING, said there was &#8220;still room for further easing in the months ahead as most global central banks are now on a rate-cut trajectory&#8221;.</p>
<p>The 50 basis point cut from the Federal Reserve last week and the similar cut from China is a sign that central banks are worried about the trajectory of the global economy. Asian equities were boosted by the Hang Seng by more than 3%, while a 1.51% gain also supported oil.</p>

<p>An aggressive <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/market-news/eurusd-exchange-rate-quiet-50bps-fed-rate-cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 basis points rate cut</a> from the Federal Reserve has led to a breakout in US stocks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40809 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP500-–-Daily-Chart.avif" alt="SP500 – Daily Chart" width="903" height="568" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP500-–-Daily-Chart.avif 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP500-–-Daily-Chart-300x189.avif 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP500-–-Daily-Chart-768x483.avif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SP500 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP500</a> has broken above the July resistance level at 5,680. These new highs can lead to further gains. Investors should beware of a false breakout where a move back below 5,680 could lead to a correction.</p>
<p>Investors were optimistic that the Federal Reserve’s half-percentage-point rate cut will steer the US economy onto a “soft landing.” In contrast, others anticipate further economic data and an earnings report from delivery services giant FedEx.</p>
<p>The Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate by the most since 2008, and its first rate reduction in over four years. The Federal Open Market Committee voted by 11 to 1 to reduce the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% after it remained elevated for one year.</p>
<p>In the central bank’s statement, policymakers said they will contemplate “additional adjustments” to rates depending on “incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned against expecting a similar pace in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2%,” Powell said.</p>
<p>Projections released after the central bank’s two-day meeting showed that 10 out of 19 policymakers supported cutting rates by at least an additional half-point during the two remaining 2024 meetings. The projections also showed an extra percentage point of cuts in 2025.</p>
<p>The Fed has a reputation for not rushing any policy changes, so there’s the potential for some disappointment at later meetings, especially if the data changes. However, a weak jobs market was one of the key reasons for the interest rate cut.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 broke above key resistance, and after the much-anticipated rate cut, further catalysts will need to remain elevated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US election drama poll swings could affect the price of the greenback going forward. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40320" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="DXY - Daily Chart" width="768" height="600" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart.png 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DXY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DXY</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has bounced from 100.61 which held the market rally through 2024. The dollar will have to hold this level or risk a further correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some confusion in markets may be occurring as polls show Kamala Harris closing the gap in the Presidential race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In overall voting, Harris is said to be leading by Trump, 48%-43%, according to one, which has a margin error of 3.1%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising expectations that former President Trump would regain the White House in November led to a so-called “Trump trade,” which believed his policies would boost corporate profits and alleviate the country’s debt spiral. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some confusion is now creeping into the market as investors are unsure what foreign and domestic policy will look like.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors had been moving into corners of the US equity market that could benefit from Trump policies such as tax cuts and regulatory easing, including small caps and energy shares. That idea also helped to fuel a rotation out of big tech stocks into other areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem in the outlook is the bond market with investors moving out of longer-term bonds as they worry about spending. UK merchant banking firm Close Brothers estimated that a second Trump term could create $4 trillion to $5 trillion of extra government borrowing over 10 years, potentially boosting inflation and hurting bond prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is unlikely that a democratic government will fare better on spending and that may be the reason that the US dollar is possibly looking for a rebound.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After defying gravity for months, <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US stocks</a> look set for a correction after chip stocks tumbled.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40264 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="SP 500 – Daily Chart" width="868" height="607" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.webp 868w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-300x210.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-768x537.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SP 500 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP 500 index</a> sank from recent resistance to trade at 5,258. There is now a risk that spooked investors will increase their sales.</p>
<p>Stocks were sharply lower on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 posting a 2-week low and the Nasdaq 100 a 2-1/2 week low. The weakness was driven by chip stocks, which have been the big driver of the AI-driven stock market rally. Nvidia’s earnings last week failed to impress investors, and the market is now on edge.</p>
<p>Weaker-than-expected ISM manufacturing and construction spending reports from the US economy hurt stocks. There was also concern that weakness in China’s economy will continue to weigh on the global outlook. China’s own manufacturing PMI unexpectedly dropped by -0.3 to a 6-month low of 49.1, despite analysts’ expectations for a move higher to 49.5.</p>
<p>Markets will now look to the important services PMI figures for the US, and a weak number could reignite recession fears. Services are 90% of the US and are tied to consumer and business activity. Services PMI is expected to dip from 51.4 to 51.1, with the 50 level being the important line in the sand for expansion. A move toward 50 or lower could add to recent stock selling.</p>
<p>That will then focus on the latest job numbers, with the country seeing a recent downgrade in previous job additions. The market is expecting to see 160k jobs added to the economy after a 114k print last month.</p>
<p>Traders are now pricing a 100% chance for a -25 bp rate cut at the September 17-18 <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/financial-events/fomc-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOMC meeting</a> and at 38% for a -50 bp rate cut at that meeting.</p>
<p>However, further economic weakness could dampen any excitement for interest rate-fuelled expansion in the economy. After the recent surge in stock prices, the S&amp;P 500 is at risk from bad news that could create a steeper correction in the market.</p>
<p>Geopolitical risks remain with intensified fighting between Ukraine and Russia, while a ceasefire is not a reality in the Middle East at the moment. There is also the upcoming US election in November, which could see a big difference in policy depending on the winner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreign investors have unwound a massive bet on a fast Chinese recovery this year, but this week&#8217;s intense day gives hope.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27706 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/China-50-–-Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="China 50 – Daily Chart" width="817" height="562" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/China-50-–-Daily-Chart.jpg 817w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/China-50-–-Daily-Chart-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/China-50-–-Daily-Chart-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">China 50 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China 50</a> blue chip index rallied by 2.40% on Thursday and now targets the previous low at 11,569. A close above that level should aim for the 12,000-12,300 price range.</p>
<p>The broader Asian share market touched five-month highs as market bets increased on aggressive rate cuts next year, extending a big rally in <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US stocks</a> and bonds and leaving investors exposed to disappointment next year. Foreign investors also bought a net 11.3 billion yuan ($1.59 billion) of <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/hk-share-cfd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese stocks</a> via the Stock Connect, which is set to be the largest daily inflow in five months.</p>
<p>In mainland markets, new energy stocks were higher by 6%, while shares in real estate developers, consumer stocks and tourism firms rose between 2% and 3%. &#8220;In the market, valuation and sentiment indicators are all at record low levels,&#8221; said Huajin Securities. The broker said markets expected possible rate cuts early next year, while recent data showing double-digit gains in China&#8217;s November industrial profits also helped sentiment.</p>
<p>The foreign investment flows are important as the FT noted a big unwind of the Chinese economic recovery bet this year. Nine-tenths of the foreign investment that flowed into China&#8217;s stock market in 2023 has already left, driven by doubts about Beijing&#8217;s desire to take serious action to boost flagging growth.</p>
<p>Since a high of Rmb235bn ($33bn) in August, net foreign investment in China-listed shares has slumped by 87% this year to Rmb30.7bn, according to the FT, using Stock Connect data.</p>
<p>International investors have been net sellers since August, spooked by missed bond payments by developer Country Garden, which threatened a larger crisis in the country&#8217;s property sector.</p>
<p>Relations between China and the US have also improved recently, but that has not improved Chinese stocks. Traders should expect a test of the lower resistance level with a chance to target 12-12,300 in early January.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US dollar</a> continued its slump as markets reopened for the last few days of trading in 2023.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27656 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DXY-Index-–-Weekly-Chart.jpg" alt="DXY Index – Weekly Chart" width="903" height="596" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DXY-Index-–-Weekly-Chart.jpg 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DXY-Index-–-Weekly-Chart-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DXY-Index-–-Weekly-Chart-768x507.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">DXY Index – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dollar index</a> was trading at $100.95 and will likely test the $100 level in the next two days. That would then be the key level for 2024, with support below $98 and $95.</p>
<p>The US dollar is selling off as traders see the peak in Federal Reserve interest rates and a move to cuts. Data has also softened around the US economy, and traders feel that the dollar has outperformed some of the world&#8217;s largest currencies. There may be worries that recession is coming closer if cuts are not sharp enough.</p>
<p>Another problem is in the political sphere, where states such as Colorado seek to remove Donald Trump from the 2024 Presidential ballot. With other court cases piling up for the leading candidate, the months ahead of the November vote could become more contentious and hurt US investment flows. Further tensions between the country&#8217;s two political parties could spill over into the debt ceiling issues and other key votes in the year ahead.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s debt rating was downgraded in 2023 by two other rating agencies who cited that political strain, but the debt is a bigger problem.</p>
<p>Former advisor to the People&#8217;s Bank of China, Yu Yongding, also said the nation should not reinvest its US treasury monies.</p>
<p>&#8220;China should accelerate the adjustment of its overseas asset and liability structure, improve returns on overseas net assets, and lower the share of foreign exchange reserves in its overseas assets&#8221;. The slowing demand was as risky for Bridgewater hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a debt crisis in this country,&#8221; Dalio said, noting the massive scale of public borrowing and lower demand for government bonds. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re going to get a meaningful slowing of the economy,&#8221; he added. Dalio said the state of US relations with China and Russia was also a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; for government debt.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">SP500 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP500</a> is trading very close to the all-time high at 4,820, which will be the January target.</p>
<p>March futures for the US S&amp;P 500 were up 0.14%, and March <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq 100</a> E-Mini futures were 0.18% on Tuesday as trading resumed following the Christmas holiday. Investors are pricing in earlier and deeper interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve next year following a softer US inflation report last week.</p>
<p>In Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s indices ended mixed, with Karuna Therapeutics up 47% after Bristol Myers Squib agreed to buy the drugmaker for $14 billion in cash. However, Nike plunged around 11% after the sportswear giant reported mixed Q2 results and cautious revenue guidance for the second half.</p>
<p>Key data from the US Department of Commerce showed that the US core PCE price index, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, was 0.1% over the month and 3.2% year-over-year in November. That was softer than expectations of 0.2% monthly and 3.3% on a yearly basis. November personal spending was also higher by 0.2% over the month, while the Michigan consumer sentiment reading was revised to a 5-month high of 69.7 in December, beating expectations of 69.4.</p>
<p>“The data was very dovish, and, of course, this is the Fed’s primary measure of inflation. But the core being below expectations and the top line also being below expectations is positive for the market, indicative that inflation is declining,” said Tim Griskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls &amp; Snyder.</p>
<p>Markets are now seeing a 14% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the next central bank meeting in January but a 75% chance of a rate cut at the March FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Asian stock markets were mixed, with China’s Shanghai Composite Index down 0.68% and <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan’s Nikkei 225</a> up 0.16%. Sentiment in the Chinese market is still weak despite authorities stepping back from a video game industry crackdown. Semiconductor and gaming stocks were lower last week, but an approval of 105 domestic games on Monday boosted the outlook for the sector.</p>
<p>Japan’s central bank governor boosted the Nikkei by saying it is not rushing to end the accommodative low-interest rate policy.</p>

<p>The last<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/markets/indices-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">CH50</a><span>&nbsp;</span>outlook we shared followed a strong rally from support, and there was hope for a breakout above the downtrend resistance. The last two weeks have us looking at the other end with a potential break of support at 12,500, likely leading to more losses.</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/live-chart/sp500" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">S&amp;P500</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in the United States was lower by 0.76% on Wednesday and will offer no support to Asian equities on Thursday.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s largest private real estate developer Country Garden is delaying payment on offshore bonds for the first time. Further fears of contagion have been raised, adding to worries about contagion risk. Zhongrong International Trust Co has also missed repayments. The trust firm has typically had large exposure to real estate.</p>
<p>JPMorgan said Monday that rising trust defaults could drag down China&#8217;s economic growth by 0.3-0.4 percentage points and expects a &#8220;vicious cycle&#8221; of real estate financing issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the apparent financial risks and their transmissions, the latest wave of defaults from wealth management firms on trust-related products is likely to cause some substantial ripple effects for the broader economy through wealth effects,&#8221; Nomura said.</p>
<p>According to Reuters&#8217; estimates, Country Garden may need to repay more than 9 billion yuan ($1.25 billion) worth of onshore bonds in September.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problems in the sector have been brewing for a long time, it wiped off the wealth effect among investors and no one wanted to buy property now,&#8221; said Dickie Wong at Kingston Securities.</p>
<p>Recent underperformance in the Chinese economy has hurt the global economy, and a rate cut in China has rippled through other markets. This week could see Chinese stocks test the key support level, and how the index performs there will determine the following weeks.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 727px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/US30%20%E2%80%93%20Weekly%20Chart%20-%20inflation%20data%20guidance.webp" alt="US30 – Weekly Chart - inflation data guidance" width="727" height="580" />US30 – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="/en/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US30</a> has found a breakout level at 34,500 and could push ahead toward the all-time high at 36,971.</p>
<p>The forecast for inflation this week is for core inflation to remain at 4.8%, while the year-on-year inflation rate is expected to rise to 3.3% from 3%. A lower reading could see a further rally in the US stock market.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was hawkish in his comments last week. Powell told reporters in Washington on July 26 that he doesn’t see inflation cooling to 2% until around 2025.</p>
<p>“The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go,” Powell said. After the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-cpi-how-affect-forex-why-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumer price index</a> increased by 0.2% in June, the US central bank raised its benchmark rate between the range of 5.25% to 5.5%.</p>
<p>The current rate of 3% is a long way from the 9.1% peak, but Powell is still looking for a sharp move to 2%. “If we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’t need to be at a restrictive level anymore,” he explained. “You’d stop raising long before you got to 2%.” Another Fed official, Michelle Bowman, said more rate hikes were needed.</p>
<p>“We have made progress in lowering inflation over the past year, but inflation is still significantly above” the Fed’s 2% target, Bowman said.</p>
<p>Bowman is one of the more hawkish members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee and said the job market “continues to be tight, with job openings still far exceeding the number of available workers.”</p>
<p>“Given these developments, I supported raising the federal funds rate at our July meeting, and I expect that additional increases will likely be needed to lower inflation to the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="/en/analysis/financial-events/fomc-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOMC</a>’s goal,” Bowman said.</p>

<p><span id="more-24062"></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/CH50%20%E2%80%93%20Weekly%20Chart%20-%20Stealth%20Breakout.webp" alt="CH50 – Weekly Chart - Stealth Breakout" width="730" height="550" loading="lazy" style="height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 730px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">CH50 – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/markets/indices-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">China 50 index</a><span>&nbsp;</span>has rallied from the 12,400 support and paused. There is now potential for the index to push higher to the 13,600 resistance level.</p>
<p>One of the drivers of a rally in Asian stocks could be the current negativity from U.S. analysts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to JPMorgan, China could soon be similar to the slow-growth, financially stagnant Japan of the 1990s if it doesn&#8217;t address its current economic challenges. Analysts said an unstable housing market, economic imbalances, and an ageing population could create the country&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="/en/analysis/market-news/japan-cpi-inflation-plunges-40-year-high" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">Japanification</a>&#8221; risk.</p>
<p>The comparison is based on the early 1990s when Japan suffered weak economic growth, low inflation, a broad decline in asset prices, and a &#8220;balance sheet recession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An alarming signal is that secondary home prices have started to fall again in some cities in recent months, after a tentative recovery in 1Q23,&#8221; the bank said. &#8220;If secondary home prices fall below new home prices, it could be a game-changer in that a mutually reinforcing decline in new home prices and secondary home prices may be formed, intensifying both macro and financial risks. Hence, it is critical to stabilize the housing market as a near-term policy priority, as emphasized by the July Politburo meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloomberg also reported that Japan is leading the chase for U.S. equity money. According to a Goldman Sachs Group, foreign buying of Japanese equities has exceeded that of China for the first time since 2017.</p>
<p>It is the perfect environment for Chinese, and Hong Kong stocks, to mount a surprise rally, and traders should watch the triangle pattern closely.&nbsp;</p>
