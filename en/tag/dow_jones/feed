<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44160" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US-30-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="US 30 – Daily Chart" width="925" height="586" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US-30-–-Daily-Chart.png 925w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US-30-–-Daily-Chart-300x190.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US-30-–-Daily-Chart-768x487.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">US 30 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US 30 saw its largest consecutive run of daily losses in years last week and a sharp selloff has led to a bounce back to test 42,000. The next two weeks will be important to see if stocks can end the year, or start 2025, in weakness or in strength. Further support below is at the 41,381 and 40,000 levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US industrial index can be an indicator of foreign investor appetite for </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many overseas investors want to own the trophy stocks in the 30-strong index. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest moves could highlight fears that overseas investors have with the Donald Trump administration. Volatility in the US dollar may have also created some negative sentiment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks rebounded on Friday after a dovish US PCE report, while the threat of a government shutdown also receded. Investors felt that Wednesday&#8217;s post-FOMC meeting selling may have been overdone. Fed Chair Jerome Powell disappointed markets by saying that the central bank would cut rates only twice in 2025, after signalling four cuts previously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks were hurt by the threat of a government shutdown at midnight Friday if Congress could pass a stop-gap funding bill. It was also a worrying sign that a Republican-controlled House could not pass the Trump-approved funding bill Thursday. That could highlight further political impasse in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any extended government shutdown would have negative consequences for US economic growth. Further stock losses came on Trump&#8217;s threat on Friday to hit the EU with tariffs if it doesn&#8217;t engage in large purchases of US oil and gas.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The threat of tariffs has been louder since the election and may be why overseas investors are selling stocks in the Dow Jones index. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday&#8217;s weaker-than-expected PCE inflation report, which saw November prices rising by +0.1% m/m and +2.4% y/y, does help to put a little pressure on the Fed’s plans.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">US 30 &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of US 30 has surged to a new all-time high above the 43,500 level. The previous high around 43,325 will provide support for the latest breakout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Index</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a key winner on the day with gains of more than 3% as investors see Trump’s policies being supportive of industrial and manufacturing firms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s clarity: We’re not going to see another January 6th event. The market is breathing a huge sigh of relief on that,” said Michael Block, coo at AgentSmyth. “The mainstream consensus was that we weren’t going to know. And we know”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is this huge perception of a business friendly, tax-friendly regime coming into place, especially with them winning the Senate,” said Block. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JPMorgan analysts wrote in a report ahead of the election result that stocks could gain through the end of 2024. However, “the uncertainty around policy execution would become more prominent in 2025”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was a market coiled for an extreme reaction one way or the other,” said Art Hogan at B Riley Wealth Management. “The market is saying: We just elected a business-friendly president. … The initial reaction to a Trump administration is met with enthusiasm that may be temporary”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has grown an average of 10% under Democrats and 6.7% under Trump’s Republicans, according to CFRA Research. GDP in the US has also underperformed at 2.4% versus 3.0% they added.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DJI – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US 30 index tested a previous gap higher from early May, and the 2024 open is 37,560. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fell Thursday after software giant </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/market-news/salesforce-release-earnings-on-wednesday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued disappointing guidance and lower revenue, hurting other software names. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 1%, while the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Nasdaq Composite dropped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce shares plunged 20% after the cloud-based software company reported its first quarterly revenue miss in 18 years and offered a soft sales outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weak bookings in Q1 further tested investor patience as the GenAI (generative AI) innovation cycle has yet to inflect top-line results and increasingly becomes a competitive concern,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a risk of a more significant correction with PCE deflator data on Friday, which could add to fears of &#8220;higher rates for longer&#8221; in the United States. Volatility in US stocks on Thursday also affected data feeds, with the CME exchange announcing a data freeze that lasted for about an hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Healthcare was another drag on the Dow Jones after the company&#8217;s CEO discussed Medicare delays at a health conference on Wednesday. UNH stock is down around 4% in the last 2 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFRA analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo that the Salesforce dump was an &#8220;overreaction. &#8220;Although some areas were disappointing, the company still saw growth of 11% during the quarter. He also believes a recovery could happen due to the company&#8217;s &#8220;recurring revenue nature.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dow Jones Daily chart</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> fell 0.7%, the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASDAQ</a> Composite fell 1.2%, and the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> closed 0.2% lower.</p>
<p>The market was awaiting the CPI data for more cues on the path of US interest rates and the economy, with expectations of some easing in inflation after the past two months’ outsized CPI readings. However, the core figure was still likely to remain above the Fed’s annual 2% target.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other central bank officials had signalled last week that they were seeking more signs that inflation was weakening before considering cutting interest rates.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">US30 – Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">US30 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> reached a record high in December above 37,000 and has continued to churn higher. A pullback to test that 37,000 level is a risk for the index in the near term. But traders should watch the supports at 37,200 for a possible bounce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Federal Reserve policymaker Chris Waller disappointed markets with his take on rate hikes this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am becoming more confident that we are within striking distance of achieving a sustainable level of 2% PCE inflation,” Waller said in prepared remarks at a virtual event hosted by the Brookings Institution on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As long as inflation doesn’t rebound and stay elevated, I believe the FOMC will be able to lower the target range for the federal funds rate this year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Waller reiterated his support for three cuts&#8230; not six like the market wants&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This view is consistent with the FOMC’s economic projections in December, in which the median projection was three 25-basis-point cuts in 2024”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And certainly does not see the need for aggressive cuts priced into the market:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When the time is right to begin lowering rates, I believe it can and should be lowered methodically and carefully,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With economic activity and labour markets in good shape and inflation coming down gradually to 2%, I see no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He reiterated that the timing of cuts and the actual number “will depend on the incoming data”, explicitly calling out the surprising strength in the December jobs report as “largely noise” against a trend of ongoing moderation. He noted that several 2023 job reports have been revised lower, and “there is a good chance December will be revised down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, Waller made it clear that The Fed is in no hurry to act:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I believe policy is set properly,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is restrictive and should continue to put downward pressure on demand to allow us to continue to see moderate inflation readings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That sent US rate cut odds tumbling to 60% for March, down from 80% at the start of the year, and has added some weight to the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">US stock indices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> this week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the week ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring data on building permits, new home sales, the house price index, consumer confidence, gross domestic product, the personal consumption expenditures price index, personal income and spending, initial jobless claims, pending home sales, and the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), as well as speeches from Federal Reserve officials Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman, Lael Brainard, Loretta Mester, Jason Furman, and Jerome Powell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wall Street is riding the momentum of a four-week winning streak for all three major averages. This streak has been fueled by the 10-year Treasury yield’s retreat from the 5% threshold it briefly surpassed in late October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the rally comes amid cautionary signals from some US retailers about a potential slowdown in consumer spending. Market participants are also keenly awaiting economic updates on the commencement of the holiday shopping season following Black Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the bond markets, US 10-year yields were at 4.492%, while 2-year yields were at 4.955%.</span></p>

<p><span id="more-24603"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5"><span style="font-size: 12px;color: #000000"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/media-4.png" width="692" height="524" loading="lazy" alt="US30: Daily Chart" style="margin: 10px auto;width: 692px;height: auto;max-width: 100%"></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: center;line-height: 1">US30: Daily Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/live-chart/dow-jones" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US30 index</a><span>&nbsp;</span>fell in the Asian and European sessions but has tried to mount a comeback in the US session. The index was still down by -0.12% around midday as the bounce was weak.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5"><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stocks</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are still under pressure from last week’s hawkish Fed talk, and the US 10-year yield was elevated to 4.5% on Monday, the highest level since October 2007.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">Analyst Albert Edwards reminded investors that the levels were “not seen since October 2007—just before everything fell apart”.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">Edwards was referring to the fall period, which was the start of the financial crisis, with subprime debt issues spilling over and crushing the housing industry in the US.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">“Meanwhile, investors are marvelling at the equity market’s resilience in the face of rising bond yields. Funny, it was just the same back in October 2007 as the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/live-chart/sp500" rel="noopener" target="_blank">S&amp;P</a><span>&nbsp;</span>hit a record high—just before everything fell apart,” he said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">“And to cap it all, the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/live-chart/crude-oil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">oil price</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in October 2007 was, like now, surging above $US90 a barrel (on its way to $US150). Three months later, after everything had indeed fallen apart, the US was in recession, bond yields and equity prices were collapsing, and the Global Financial Crisis was upon us”.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">However, Edwards said that the banking system is very different from that period and is safer and more resilient.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman is also predicting higher levels on the 30-year Treasury and continues to bet in that direction.</p>

<p><span id="more-24541"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><span style="font-size: 12px;color: #000000"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/media-2.png" width="705" height="533" loading="lazy" alt="US30: Daily Chart" style="width: 705px;height: auto;max-width: 100%;margin: 10px auto"></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: center;line-height: 1">US30: Daily Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The US30 trades at 34,559 and may even test the August lows at 34,000 this week.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Treasury yields were higher on Monday, driven by strong economic data from the previous week and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy decision due on Wednesday. Recent economic indicators, such as firm inflation readings, solid retail sales, and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/market-news/wti-brent-oil-prices-10-month-high-fed-meeting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rising oil prices</a>, have pushed the 10-year Treasury yield towards its highest levels since the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/financial-events/2008-financial-crisis-3-causes-3-effects-3-lessons-learned" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The market is heavily pricing in a pause in the Fed funds rate this week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. However, the odds of an increase of 25 basis points to a range of 5.50% – 5.75% at the subsequent meeting in November are now only 28.7%. That could set stocks up for disappointment in the coming event.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Analysts from BofA Securities, including Michael Gapen, Mark Cabana, and Alex Cohen, said they see no alterations to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s balance sheet policies and predict it will hold its target range for the federal funds rate at the September meeting. This is due to recent Fed policymaker comments and market pricing.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Monday also showed a sentiment index for US home builders dropping in September, falling below the breakeven level. Traders expect that some recent economic weakness could force the central bank to pause.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">On Monday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she saw no signs that the US economy was moving into a downturn but said a failure by Congress to pass legislation to keep the government running risked slowing momentum.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any signs that the economy is at risk of a downturn,&#8221; Yellen told CNBC.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely no reason for a shutdown,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Creating a situation that could cause a loss of momentum is something we don&#8217;t need as a risk at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Traders are fully expecting a pause from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, and stocks would be rattled by any change in that outlook.</p>

<p><span id="more-24376"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><span style="font-size: 12px;color: #000000"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/US30%20Daily%20Chart.png" width="751" height="470" loading="lazy" alt="US30: Daily Chart" style="width: 751px;height: auto;max-width: 100%;margin: 10px auto"></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: center;line-height: 1">US30: Daily Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The&nbsp;<a href="/en/live-chart/dow-jones" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">US30</a>&nbsp;trades at 34,837 after a push higher last week. The 35,000 level is the next test, with 34,000 on the downside.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">As traders return from the annual summer vacation period, we could see volumes increase and larger moves, with the possibility of either or both of those support or resistance levels being tested.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Last week was disappointing for US economic data, with a rise in unemployment and lower GDP growth figures. However, that raises the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate pause, and that could be bullish.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">ISM manufacturing will be closely watched this week on Wednesday, while a return of COVID to the news cycle should also be a concern for growth outlooks.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;We are beginning to see this slow glide into a cooler labour market,’’ said Becky Frankiewicz at employment firm ManpowerGroup. &#8220;Make no mistake: Demand is cooling off. But it’s not a freefall.’’&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The latest sign that hiring is losing some momentum would likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has been trying to cool inflation with eleven interest rate hikes. The Fed is hoping to achieve a &#8220;soft landing,&#8221; where hiring and growth slow enough to cool price increases without triggering a recession. Economists have doubted that the Fed would succeed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The ISM manufacturing number could boost stocks if it follows the current tone that the economy is slowing without a freefall scenario.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The next Federal Reserve interest rate meeting falls on September 20, and markets will have almost three weeks to watch further economic data for clues on the next path. The US earnings calendar is light this week with only a few mid-level tech stocks releasing their results, so traders should look at Tuesday onwards for a return of volume that could act on recent data from the holidays.</p>

<p><span id="more-24155"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/US30%E2%80%93Daily-Chart-Resistance.webp" alt="US30–Daily-Chart-Resistance" width="703" height="537" loading="lazy" style="height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 703px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto">US30 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The 35,000 level is now key for the US30 index, or stocks could face a more significant correction.</p>
<p>The US market could not capitalize on stronger retail sales, with a print of 0.7%, beating estimates of 0.4%. Lower inflation and consumer strength had painted a stronger picture for domestic demand, but external issues weighed.</p>
<p>US futures slumped lower as Treasury bond yields pushed further into yearly highs, as investors grew concerned about China&#8217;s post-Covid recovery. Following softer data, PBOC officials slashed key interest rates, including a benchmark one-year bank lending rate. However, the world&#8217;s second-largest economy also has a backdrop of property stress.</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s production, consumption and investment slowed more than expected in July despite efforts to boost domestic demand, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed,&#8221; said Saxo Bank strategists. &#8220;Coming on top of a whole host of weaker than expected data recently, the People&#8217;s Bank of China responded by unexpectedly cutting two<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/market-news/chinese-stocks-lag-government-stimulus-plan" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">key policy</a><span>&nbsp;</span>rates for a second time in three months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The central bank&#8217;s efforts pushed Asian stocks into the red, which hurt the European and US sessions. The Chinese government also suspended the publication of youth unemployment data, worried it would lead to further market disruption.</p>
<p>US Treasury yields are also rising, with the Treasury planning to raise more than $103 billion in bond sales this quarter while adding $132 billion in T-bill sales into the market yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Fitch Ratings analyst also told CNBC that the agency could downgrade more lenders, including Wall Street titan JP Morgan, while a proposed rule change by a top banking regulator added to investor concerns. Several worries are building after a big run in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">tech stocks</a><span>&nbsp;</span>this year, and investors should be on guard for a pullback.</p>
<p>Large investors could add to any sell-off after a Bank of America poll of asset managers, collectively managing $685 billion in assets, are the least bearish in 18 months, holding the lowest proportion of cash since November 2021. That was the previous market top when central banks started turning off the easy money taps.</p>
