<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46120" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EURCHF-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURCHF – Daily Chart" width="664" height="535" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EURCHF-–-Daily-Chart.png 664w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EURCHF-–-Daily-Chart-300x242.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURCHF – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a weekly level, the EUR v CHF has hit resistance at 0.95 and may look to test the bottom of the range. It may be an opportunity to sell short rallies in the euro that are not driven by any major catalyst. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss GDP at 4pm HKT is expected to show a lower 0.2% growth reading for Q4 than the previous quarter’s 0.4%. On an annual level, the figure is expected to be 1.6% against a previous 2%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Swiss franc is always seen as a safe haven due to its location in terms of geopolitics and the country always had a neutral stance on wars. The country is home to many secretive banking accounts and that can keep it free from any attacks. However, the country is far from the current Russia/Ukraine conflict. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last two weeks has seen the United States and Europe diverge on Ukraine with a UN vote that failed to blame Russia for the conflict. President Trump has also been aiming to broker peace and left European leaders out of the room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany’s election of a pro-Nato candidate has also seen criticism lodged at the US  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friedrich Merz won the latest German election and said the following: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program. But after Donald Trump’s statements last week at the latest, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe. For me, the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can achieve real independence from the USA step by step”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dynamic of global politics is changing and Britain has vowed this week to increase defense spending as the US pulls away. Even if a peace deal is brokered by the United States, the situation is still unstable and there are repercussions as European countries raise military spending when they are already struggling to balance the books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The euro remains subdued against the chf franc and the threat may be to the downside.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURCHF</a> exchange rate has data ahead of Tuesday as the pair seeks to mount a rally after a recent weakness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-44566 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EURCHF-Daily-Chart-1.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EURCHF-Daily-Chart-1.jpg 718w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EURCHF-Daily-Chart-1-300x239.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">EURCHF &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of the EURCHF exchange rate has bounced from the lows near 0.925, which could be setting a double bottom from the lows of 2024. A push to test the 0.9500 level is needed.</p>
<p>The European currency has been on a downward slump from highs set in May 2024. That took prices down to the lows of late-2023, and we now have a second test of support. Recent fears over French bond spreads appear to have receded for the moment after the appointment of another Prime Minister. The Swiss currency is often used as a safe haven in troubled times, and some profit-taking or short-covering appears to be in play.</p>
<p>Tesla supplied 495,570 automobiles in the fourth quarter, which was up 2.3% over the previous quarter, but Q4 is always a strong quarter. The number fell short of revised Wall Street projections of 498,000. Analysts also noted that Tesla&#8217;s average sales price dropped to $41,000 during the quarter, its lowest in four years. That could affect the company&#8217;s margins, which have struggled since the price war started.</p>
<p>Data on Tuesday starts with the 15:30 pm HKT release of Swiss <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-cpi-how-affect-forex-why-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPI</a> data, where consumer prices are expected to be down from 0.7% in November to 0.6% for December. A lower number could see the euro improve against the Swiss franc. Similar data for the French economy is expected to show a slight increase on a monthly basis from 1.7% to 1.9%.</p>
<p>Consumer prices will be released for the European economy and are expected to show a 2.7% year-on-year increase. That will be the same as last month, but any sign that European prices are more stubborn than those in Switzerland can show some strength in the euro. European unemployment will be released at the same time.</p>
<p>Retail sales are released for Germany at 3 pm HKT on Wednesday and could also add some fuel to the euro if consumers in Europe&#8217;s largest economy can bounce back.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have made significant progress in 2024 in bringing down inflation and hopefully 2025 is the year when we are on target as expected and as planned in our strategy,&#8221; ECB President Christine Lagarde said on X last week. Some economists have criticised the bank for being too slow with rate cuts, and any inflation dip will increase calls to cut again.</p>
