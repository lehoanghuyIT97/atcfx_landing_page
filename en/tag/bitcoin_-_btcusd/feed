										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong move for </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the weekend has the coin on course for a test of the highs above $109,000. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50348" style="width: 745px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50348" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD – Daily Chart" width="745" height="540" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 745w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50348" class="wp-caption-text">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found strong support with the stock market as it tested the $76,768 level. The coin now looks to push for the $109,000 level this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move to new highs could come easily as talk of the bullish weekend could see </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors rushing to catch the trend. Bitmex founder Arthur Hayes has predicted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million before 2028. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new round of bullish price predictions could see investors trying to join the rally. Hayes believes that capital controls worldwide and US Treasury “devaluation” means that Bitcoin will become a popular safe haven for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of US Treasurys will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volume in this upmove has not been particularly strong and that could provide further fuel for a breakout this week. Credit ratings agency Moodys rattled the US dollar last week with a downgrade for the country’s debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing the debt rating from &#8216;AAA&#8217; to &#8216;Aa1&#8217;, Moody&#8217;s noted that successive US administrations had not done enough to tackle rising deficits and interest costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downgrade &#8220;reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,&#8221; a Moody&#8217;s statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could add to the safe haven theme and bring traders into the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week. </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US tech stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are around -4% lower from their previous highs and may look to close that gap this week. A move in risk-on assets would be another boost for Bitcoin as it looks to test the all-time highs.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_48862" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48862" style="width: 808px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48862" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTC-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTC - Daily Chart" width="808" height="520" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTC-Daily-Chart.png 808w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTC-Daily-Chart-300x193.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTC-Daily-Chart-768x494.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48862" class="wp-caption-text">BTC &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">price of BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trades at $94,832 and is testing the level that provided strong support into 2025. This will be the deciding level and links two previous highs from 2017 and 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) has been buying up BTC in the market again, despite a Q1 loss. The company acquired 1,895 bitcoins during the week of April 28 to May 4, 2025, at an average price of $95,167. The purchase brings its total holdings to 555,450 BTCs valued at around $38.08 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purchases were funded through stock offering programs, under which the company sold its own shares. The company says it sold 353,825 shares of its 2024 common stock shares and 575,392 </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/preference-shares" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preferred stock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares, raising $180.3 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest buying spree, Strategy&#8217;s market value has increased to $52.2 billion, which is 2.6% of the total BTC in supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has bought more BTC despite posting a Q1 2025 net loss from operations widening to $5.921 billion, compared to $203.7 million for the first quarter of 2024. The company is now an all-or-nothing bet on the price of the world’s largest </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company used the recent speculative rally as confirmation that it is doing well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The company says it saw a strong start to the year, with a year-to-date ‘BTC Yield’ of 13.7%, achieving over 90% of its 2025 target in just the first four months of the year. Our year-to-date &#8216;BTC $Gain’ of $5.8 billion also meets 58% of our annual target, demonstrating the effectiveness of our Bitcoin strategy”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy is performing well with the recent Q1 BTC rally but is heavily invested in BTC at elevated levels. The price of BTC can continue higher with strength in stocks but the recent tariff slump in stocks highlights the risk in the market.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank has announced another </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purchase plan despite losing on the token in 2018.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48544" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48544" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48544" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD – Daily Chart" width="865" height="547" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 865w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x190.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x486.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48544" class="wp-caption-text">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTCUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has rallied this week to sit near $93,700 and a push to $100k Is possible next week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese investment giant SoftBank is testing the crypto waters again with the new bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicle, Twenty One Capital, in conjunction with Tether, Bitfinex, and Cantor Fitzgerald. It is another welcome sign of institutional flows for bulls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Group has $308 billion assets under management and is another sign of a large corporation buying into the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The US tech giant put a vote to its shareholders over the last year to invest in BTC but it was voted down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For other investors, there is a worry that it is a bad omen for crypto after a previous loss. In 2019, SoftBank made headlines when its founder, Masayoshi Son, took a big loss on a personal bitcoin investment. Son had taken exposure to cryptocurrency in late 2017, when the ICO mania was peaking and bitcoin was trading at an all-time high of around $20,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With bitcoin now trading at $93,000, Son’s investment would have been very profitable had he held it. But he sold in early 2018 as bitcoin began to crash, resulting in a $130 million loss, according to the WSJ. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains to be seen how Son will do this time around but the move can help some short-term gains in Bitcoin after the coin has rallied from a recent correction. Some safe haven flows have arrived after ETF flows have been reduced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new TwentyOne investment vehicle has already placed $4bn of BTC on its balance sheet and looks set to add more in the coming months. A pause in tariffs could see less market volatility and a return to speculative investments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BTCUSD – Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTCUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is mixed on the week and a failure to advance could lead to selling through the $73,745 level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly chart provides a clearer picture of the trend with BTC still trading below the key resistance around $95,000. The last few weeks have seen some consolidation but a failure to get above $80-90k leaves the world’s largest cryptocurrency in a vulnerable setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uncertainty over tariffs has seen a record outflow from Bitcoin </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with $326 million leaving the exchange-traded crypto vehicles. That marked the largest one day outflow since March 11 and signalled a sharp shift in market sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlackRock’s IBIT fund, one of the leading Bitcoin ETFs, was one of the hardest hit, suffering $253 million in outflows. That ranks at number three in the worst days since the product’s launch. The large outflows also added to a losing streak that reached four days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump’s tariffs across the world were quickly reversed after bond market panic and the uncertainty has traders taking some money out of riskier investment opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin ETFs were not isolated with the crypto selling pain as </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/ethereum-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spot ETFs also experienced outflows on Tuesday, with $3.3 million pulled from the funds, suggesting a broader pullback from the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin’s current consolidation highlights the potential for further downside if buyers do not emerge. The market mood has changed about Trump’s crypto plans and tech stocks have also suffered from the recent turmoil, hurting the appetite for BTC and the potential for moving profits from stocks into crypto.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>BTC slipped to $82,500 ahead of Tuesday’s session and could look to retest the $78250 support. The post-election rally starred at $67,668 and that can be the next target.</p>
<p>BlackRock management believes that he U.S. dollar could lose its status as the world’s reserve currency to Bitcoin or other digital assets if the United States does not get its debt under control.</p>
<p>Chairman Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter to Investors that “decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation” that makes “markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent”. But “that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar”.</p>
<p>The U.S. debt equaled 122.3% of the country’s gross domestic product in 2023, which was higher than the 105% seen in 2018.</p>
<p>If every asset ends up being tokenized, Fink said, “it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth”.</p>
<p>That forward-looking assessment is not helping the price of BTC in the short-term as the price has struggled in 2025.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s strategic reserve has disappointed investors as it will only hold BTC that was recovered by Federal investigators. Coins such as Solana and XRP may fare better with outright purchases later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s tariffs</a> were set to come into effect on Wednesday 2 April but they have already rocked markets and it remains to be seen if the global economy will suffer in coming months. A reduction in economic activity could weaken the appetite for tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sunday slide in Bitcoin could spread into the US market on Monday.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46603" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD – Daily Chart" width="940" height="580" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 940w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the failure to hold gains ahead of $90,000, </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has slipped to $80,000 and threatens the support at $73,745. That was a resistance level in March 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin was seen sliding after markets were not impressed by the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/xrpusd-surges-donald-trump-reserve-talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic reserve plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Donald Trump’s administration. That was largely due to the fact that the reserve was going to be largely built with coins that have been seized by the authorities, rather than buying in the spot market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also fears for the US economy as Trump’s tariffs come into effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There could be a little disruption,&#8221; said US President Donald Trump when asked about the impact of his tariff and budget-cutting policies. &#8220;If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective … we go by quarters,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;What we’re doing is building a foundation for the future”.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States have also been rattled over the last two weeks and now trade back at levels seen at his election win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market participants had cheered the arrival of Trump to bring a business boost but his policies have rattled the status quo with tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaliation threats from other countries have set the stage for a fallout that could see wild swings in GDP, or other economic data in certain countries over the coming months and raise recession risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin’s market capitalization has dropped by $230 billion since Thursday and risks dragging the crypto sector lower if support levels continue to be tested in the week ahead. That could depend on the activity in US stocks as they also look for a bottom in recent falls.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin was back to bearish mode with a dip toward the support at $92k on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46048" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BTCUSD-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD – Weekly Chart" width="855" height="508" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BTCUSD-–-Weekly-Chart.png 855w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BTCUSD-–-Weekly-Chart-300x178.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BTCUSD-–-Weekly-Chart-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BTCUSD – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTCUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price is back testing the uptrend that links two highs in 2021. The failure to sustain the break above that level could lead to a correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s largest cryptocurrency was under pressure, alongside the broader crypto sector, as US stocks struggled to shake off a recent downturn. That highlighted again that BTC is simply following the cue of speculative tech stock buying like it did before the post-2021 drop. A correction in stocks could be costly for the coin and Donald Trump has failed to enact any new crypto plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What goes up can often be the first to go down and the worst performer among the major crypto tokens was Solana (SOL). Riding a wave of activity around Trump’s election and the release of his own token, SOL is now down 10% over the past 24 hours and a 41% over the past month as another memecoin frenzy ends badly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quinn Thompson, founder of a crypto hedge fund, told Coindesk there was an 80% chance that bitcoin won’t make new highs over the next three months, with a 51% chance we won&#8217;t see new highs over the next 12 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts are turning on </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over fears that the labor market is under stress, with wages slowing down. The global tariff wars have also hurt sentiment over economic growth and </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prices.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has recovered from the recent test of support around $90,000. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45064" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD – Daily Chart" width="763" height="580" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 763w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x228.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has risen again above the $100,000 level. The strong support is just below and it will be crucial for Trump to deliver on his crypto plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin was able to test the recent highs but slipped back after Trump made no mention of crypto in his address. The Ethereum-bitcoin ratio also dropped to the lowest since 2021 as incoming President Trump is seen favouring BTC. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/ethereum-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has underperformed its rival as Solana gained traction through the memecoin frenzy. Trump recently launched an official memecoin on the Solana network instead of Ethereum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That said, World Liberty Financial&#8217;s recent accumulation of $ETH highlights that Ethereum continues to maintain strong appeal among institutions. As the only cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin with an </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ethereum is well-positioned to be the next focal point after Bitcoin,” Jung added. World Liberty Financial is a crypto lending platform promoted by Trump and his sons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now around the $42 mark, TRUMP has surged to a $8.8 billion market capitalization, making it the 25th largest coin in the market. Bitcoin has surged against its competitors but is also gaining on gold with bitcoin against the gold market cap now as high as 11.4%. Trump announced his administration’s “America First Priorities” on Monday, but none mentioned </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or his planned strategic Bitcoin reserve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a White House briefing, Trump’s priorities include public safety, boosting energy independence, and reforming government bureaucracy. Bitcoin now must hold the $100k level or a correction below the recent support test could happen.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-44650 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BTCUSD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD - Daily Chart" width="1006" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BTCUSD-Daily-Chart.png 1006w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BTCUSD-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BTCUSD-Daily-Chart-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BTCUSD &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The line on the chart connects to the two previous all-time highs and is a pivotal line for the path ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto-tracking futures betting on higher prices saw a liquidation of $560 million as buyers ran away. Inflation was a boogeyman once again after the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report on the US service economy was stronger than anticipated. The price paid measure was at its highest level since 2023. We then had the Federal Reserve talking of higher inflation ahead and blaming the Trump administration’s policies. That is a blow for crypto traders as hopes for crypto-friendly efforts may be negated by the inflationary threat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US job openings were also higher which shows strength in the employment market and allows the Fed to remain in a hawkish stance with interest rates. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were also lower after the data but were helped by dovish comments from Fed Governor Waller who said, “The extent of further easing will depend on what the data tell us about progress toward 2% inflation, but my bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">X user Trader Skew also noted $95,000 as the key short-term level for BTC at the moment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Around 1 day chart lows ($92K &#8211; 88K), bid liquidity has been buffered up a decent amount with increased demand,” he wrote. A move into those levels would break the long-term support line and put BTC in a pressure situation ahead of Trump’s inauguration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also has a sentencing to deal with a hush-money case and traders should use caution on BTC longs as that develops on the 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some weakness, Fidelity asset management believes that demand will increase for Bitcoin in 2025 from institutional buyers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We anticipate more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in bitcoin,&#8221; analyst Matt Hogan wrote. A lot may depend on Trump and whether the strategic reserve fund comes to fruition.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the US were to set up a Bitcoin fund then other countries may try to keep up and lead to a rush for the coin in 2025. For now, traders should keep an eye on the $94-95k level as short-term support.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin was down -2.3% in Monday trading as volatility returns to the downside. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44192" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BTCUSD-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD - Weekly Chart" width="955" height="558" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BTCUSD-Weekly-Chart.png 955w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BTCUSD-Weekly-Chart-300x175.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BTCUSD-Weekly-Chart-768x449.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BTCUSD &#8211; Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">price of Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is testing a very important resistance line that links the previous two all-time highs. A failure here would mean the $100k push was a false breakout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin has now slipped to trade at the $92,944 level and the key support line now comes in around $90,000 for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Support below that level could be at the $73,739 price level, which was the previous all-time high in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto market has seen large outflows after the latest FOMC meeting said that the Federal Reserve would only cut rates two times in 2025, rather than four. On Thursday, investors pulled a record $576 million from crypto ETFs, according to CoinShares data. By Friday, the outflow had risen to $1 billion. </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had seen an additional $3.2 billion worth of assets the previous week, meaning that inflows dropped more than -90% week-over-week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest fall in price now adds jitters to the market at the key price level. Further panic selling could see an end to the 2024 bull market that has been driven by the arrival of BlackRock and other institutional firms to the ETF market. BTC also rose sharply after the election win of Donald Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors have been expecting the incoming President to set up a Bitcoin strategic reserve fund, although the idea was dismissed as “crazy” by a former Treasury Secretary.</span></p>
