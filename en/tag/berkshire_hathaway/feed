										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Famed investor Warren Buffett will host the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate and investors will be interested in his views of the economy. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48779" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48779" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48779" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRK-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BRK - Daily Chart" width="823" height="492" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRK-Daily-Chart.png 823w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRK-Daily-Chart-300x179.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRK-Daily-Chart-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48779" class="wp-caption-text">BRK &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BRK shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tumbled with the trade war in April but bounced back to the recent highs near 800,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren Buffett had a strong year in 2024 as he sold two of his favorite stocks, built his cash pile to more than $300 billion, and led Berkshire Hathaway to a $1 trillion market value for the first time ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 94-year-old investor had to say goodbye to his trusted partner, gave $6 billion to good causes, and provided further clarity on his plans to give away his fortune. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key themes on Buffett has been the huge cash pile as the value investor sees little opportunity to load up on his stocks. Investors will be looking for clarity on the recent </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tariff trade wars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to see if the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ made any purchases.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berkshire Hathaway currently has a market capitalization of around $1 trillion, making it the seventh most valuable publicly-traded company in the US, ahead of Tesla. If there is any concern this year it will surround the company’s insurance bets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early estimates on recent fires in Los Angeles suggest that damages may total $1.3 billion. Investors are usually interested in Buffett’s views on Apple stock. In 2016, Berkshire Hathaway invested in a technology stock for the first time but Buffett’s late partner Charlie Munger, said it wasn’t a tech company. He said that Apple was actually a great consumer company, similar to their successful investments in Coca-Cola. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2018, Berkshire had built an Apple stake of more than 1 billion shares. However, from 2024, the company started to reduce its holdings. The gains from those sales are now held in cash and Treasury securities and total around $318 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As thousands descend on Omaha for the annual meeting, they will be keen to hear about tariffs and the path of the US economy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate will share its latest earnings. Still, investors will be focused on the Oracle of Omaha’s economic ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25485" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brk-chart.png" alt="brk chart" width="826" height="556" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brk-chart.png 826w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brk-chart-300x202.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brk-chart-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">BRK – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BRK trades at $348 after a recent downturn, which saw the stock hit $332. The current level has resistance to a more significant push higher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Berkshire’s earnings are always eagerly anticipated, with Buffett giving his thoughts on the economy, stocks, and investing strategy.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities/oil-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> may be an exciting topic after he bought up a large stock holding in Occidental Petroleum. Investors will also eagerly await his comments on Apple, the company’s largest single stock holding at 50% of the total stock portfolio. Buffett previously said it was the best stock he owned, and investors will want an update after a sales dip and a Chinese government </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/apple-shares-risk-further-loss-china-iphone-ban" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">ban on iPhones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> being reported in September. Apple stock was down 12% in the third quarter, which would shave $20 billion in value from Berkshire’s 900 million shareholding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Berkshire has sold shares in Chinese automaker BYD 13 times since August last year, netting $843.7 million, but still has a 7.9% stake in the firm. Berkshire Hathaway probably lost in the third quarter due to the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">stock market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> decline on its extensive equity portfolio. Still, Buffett’s company should deliver more substantial operating earnings. The conglomerate owns many businesses with an insurance division, manufacturers, oil and gas interests, railroads, and candy retailers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The increase in operating profits for the quarter will be driven mainly by higher rates lifting interest income on Berkshire’s cash balance of almost $150 billion, which is invested primarily on Treasury bills, now yielding close to 5%. Investors will want to hear Buffett’s thoughts on where rates will go and whether the US economy will see a recession. Investors will also look at Berkshire’s stock repurchases as an indication of Buffett’s view on the value of his shares.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may be the case that the Berkshire Hathaway Share Price has performed no worse than many blue chip stocks so far this year, but with investors wondering whether its 90 year old supremo has lost his magic touch, and Apple is such a big percentage of its holdings, some are wondering whether the investment company has seen its best days now that we are in a pandemic environment?</p>
<p>Investments like the quick win in the Snowflake IPO may start to become more common and more necessary to maintain growth for BRKB shares.</p>
<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener">Learn more about shares trading with ATFX</a></p>
<p><span id="more-10337"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The BRKB share price falls 11% in 2020</h2>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">While it is the stuff of legend to quote how much a $1,000 investment in Berkshire Hathaway shares would have made you from the start of Warren Buffett’s career, tens of millions of dollars being the answer, some of the shine has started to come off BRKB shares so far in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">While the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly a factor, there would appear to be more to the 11% loss for the Berkshire Hathaway share price so far this year than just stock market trends. This point is underlined by the way that the BRKB share price fell 5% in October alone. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Berkshire Hathaway shares benefit from snowflake’s IPO<br /></span></h3>
<p>While BRKB shares have so far struggled this year, there have been positive highlights. The most noteworthy in the near term was the $735m investment Berkshire Hathaway made in cloud data technology group Snowflake as it floated on the US market at $120. In September they initially peaked at $319, delivering a $1bn gain for Berkshire Hathaway.</p>
<p>While this was a significant win, it highlighted two reasons that the Berkshire Hathaway share price has not only underperformed, but also not been able to match the glory years of its early decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Have BRKB shares just become a play on Apple?</h3>
<p>Although tech stocks came into focus in a high profile way during the time of the Dotcom Boom in 1999-2000, it has been in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 where so called FAANGS stocks have stretched to trillion dollar valuations, dwarfing old economy companies. The FAANGS such as Google, Apple and Facebook were clearly momentum plays, rather than value stocks that Warren Buffett and the Berkshire Hathaway share price rise had previously been based.</p>
<p>However, as if to compensate for this omission, from 2016 Berkshire Hathaway shares biggest holding has been Apple. As of the end of September 2020 49% of Berkshire Hathaway comprised of Apple shares. The initial $35bn investment has nearly tripled in value. However, this does beg the question whether investors should just invest in FAANGS stocks, rather than buy Berkshire Hathaway shares?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can Berkshire Hathaway shares outperform again?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">Historically BRKB shares were founded on the concepts of blue chip companies, with recurring income, which were long term investments &#8211; sometimes decades long. For instance, Coca Cola is a core holding for Berkshire Hathaway shares, and has been with the holding company for more than 30 years. Kraft Heinz has been a rather more problematic holding, but fits the bill of being an evergreen consumer staple. The issue now for those looking to see Berkshire Hathaway shares soar to previous heights the stock market will have to end its love of technology shares, and return to the traditional names. Even in a time of pandemic when there has been some return to consumer stocks, so far this pales into insignificance relative to the big tech names.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;font-weight: normal">BRKB shares: paying dividends</h2>
<p>Fashions on the stock market come and go, and while technology is the current fad, it should be remembered that the Berkshire Hathaway share price has been based on long held dividend plays, not quick position flipping.</p>
<p>For instance, Warren Buffett’s entry on Coca Cola shares was so low and so long ago, BRKB shares received a yield of 50% on the holding. This is a performance that few companies can either match or sustain.</p>
