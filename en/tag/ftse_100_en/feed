										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading">UK stocks</a> were in focus on Wednesday as the country’s Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivered his spring Budget statement, including measures to boost investment in the City of London financial centre.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30563 aligncenter" src="https://.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UK100-Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="UK100-Daily-Chart" width="730" height="615" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UK100-Daily-Chart.jpg 730w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UK100-Daily-Chart-300x253.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FTSE 100 (UK 100) &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading">UK’s FTSE 100 share index</a> closed slightly higher, but the market is stuck in a range with resistance at the 7,750 level holding up since December 2023.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 was relatively steady following the lunchtime UK speech, indicating that there were no major surprises for investors.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hunt’s Budget included plans for a British ISA, which will give investors an additional £5,000 tax-free allowance to invest exclusively in UK companies when they have used up the current £20,000 yearly limit.</p>
<p>The new measures saw a mixed response from savings and investment experts, with some suggesting that it will have a limited impact on the City as it helps wealthy investors. However, the new ISA has the potential to drive new capital flows to UK companies, including small and mid-cap companies.</p>
<p>Chris Cummings, chief executive of Investment Association Other said that the measure could encourage people to abandon diversification.</p>
<p>The Chancellor’s Budget was safe and unlikely to lead to any fallout in global markets, but the cautiously optimistic tone of Jeremy Hunt’s speech helped to boost the British pound.</p>
<p>The performance of the FTSE in contrast to US stocks is evident in the stock chart and it is a worry that the market is showing such weakness when markets are happy. US stocks are higher due to the concentration of big global brands in the US indices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="line-height: 2">The UK stock market was higher for a second week despite a gloomy outlook for the property sector.<span style="font-size: 12px;color: #000000"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/FTSE%20100%20Weekly%20Chart.png" width="596" height="473" loading="lazy" alt="FTSE 100: Weekly Chart" style="height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 596px;margin: 10px auto"></span></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: center;line-height: 1">FTSE 100: Weekly Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The <a href="/en/markets/indices-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>FTSE 100</span></a> closed last week at 7488 after a second week in the green and will need to see further strength this week to confirm the bullish trend.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The market was higher in London, even as fresh data from online real estate portal Zoopla projected the biggest dip in housing sales for a decade in 2023. The monthly monitor found that sales volumes were down 20% compared with 2022 and forecast sales to be the lowest since 2012 by the end of the year.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Housing prices have dipped as mortgage rates rise due to a period of persistently high inflation and central bank rate hikes.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;It is the number of sales that have been hit hardest by higher borrowing costs, especially among mortgage-reliant buyers,&#8221; said Richard Donnell, director at Zoopla.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The report also said that house price growth has slowed to its lowest rate in 12 years as people are priced out of the market by rising mortgage rates. According to the data, buyer demand fell by more than a third in the month ending August 20.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Meanwhile, the Bank of England data said mortgage approvals dipped 10% in July, to 49,400 from 54,600 in June. June saw mortgage rates hit fresh highs.</p>
