										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese EV shares dropped this week after BYD, a leading EV manufacturer, increased fears of a tough price war. The company&#8217;s aggressive price cuts have been rattling the sector, adding to fears over profitability and competition. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50725" style="width: 729px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50725" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NIO – Daily Chart" width="729" height="529" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart.png 729w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50725" class="wp-caption-text">NIO – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIO (NYSE:NIO) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were lower on the news with a move from the $4 level to prices under $3.80. This is a key level for the stock as a failure could move further down toward the $3 lows of April. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of Geely, Li Auto, and Xpeng saw declines of 7%, 5%, and 4% respectively, after BYD announced significant price reductions on 22 models, including the entry-level Seagull EV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price cuts are a strategic move by BYD to maintain its market leadership,&#8221; said analysts at Financial Times. &#8220;However, this aggressive pricing strategy could lead to a prolonged price war, affecting the entire industry&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a clear indication that the price war in the Chinese EV market is heating up,&#8221; said an analyst from South China Morning Post. &#8220;BYD&#8217;s move is likely to force other manufacturers to follow suit, leading to a potential race to the bottom&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price war raises concerns about the profitability of rival Chinese EV manufacturers, especially those that are targeted at higher-end consumers, such as NIO. BYD&#8217;s latest profit forecast fell short of analyst’s expectations, highlighting the challenges created by the intense competition in electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent setback, BYD was optimistic about its long-term prospects. In a statement released after the earnings, the company emphasized its commitment to innovation and market leadership. The latest price cuts by BYD may also be an effort to hit Tesla while it has already been struggling.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price war could lead to a shakeout in the Chinese EV market,&#8221; said an analyst from NBC Los Angeles. &#8220;Only the most competitive and innovative companies will be able to withstand the pressure&#8221;.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle maker </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will release its latest earnings on Tuesday after some recent sales gains.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46698" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIO-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="NIO – Weekly Chart" width="863" height="594" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIO-–-Weekly-Chart.png 863w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIO-–-Weekly-Chart-300x206.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIO-–-Weekly-Chart-768x529.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NIO – Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIO stock has found itself in a range between $3.70 and $7 in the US ADR. The $3.70 support is closest but an </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surprise could see some sharp upward momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, CNBC reported that sales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models made up 20% of all new car and truck sales for the first time in 2024. Motor Intelligence said that more than 3.2 million electrified vehicles were sold last year, including 1.9 million hybrid vehicles and 1.3 all-electric vehicles for the US market. Chinese EV sales also saw a bumper year and that helped NIO to a record annual sales number, delivering 72,689 vehicles, for a 45.2% increase year-over-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At NIO Day in December 2024, the company launched ET9, its flagship electric car that showcases advanced technology in multiple areas, including intelligent driving. NIO plans to start deliveries of the ET9 by the end of March. Additionally, the company introduced FIREFLY as its new high-end electric car brand, which is expected to be launched in April 2025. Both of these new models could see another strong year in sales for NIO and the stock price may see a recovery with an earnings surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Nio to post a loss of 34 cents per share vs. a 39-cent loss a year ago, according to FactSet. They also see revenue at the company rising 17.9% to $2.802 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nio continues to work on a turnaround strategy with improving sales and more affordable vehicles. Some analysts say Nio&#8217;s venture into mass-market and budget brands may hurt its premium image, but the company is set on targeting a &#8220;broader global market&#8221; with its new models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe has pushed back on Chinese vehicles saturating the market and Donald Trump is unleashing heavy tariffs, so it is not a great environment to see global sales growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts will be looking to see positive free cash flow and effective working capital management from the company as it seeks to create a stable foundation. In the previous quarter, Nio’s CEO, William Li, told investors on the company’s earnings call that he expects the company to break even on a full-year basis in 2026. That means the company’s upcoming earnings will have to show a continued trend of narrowing losses, driven by rising shipments and continued spending cuts.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">NIO &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The price of NIO trades around 7.48 on the US market, and support is nearby at 7.15. The shares need a positive earnings spin to mount a rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Tuesday, Shanghai-based NIO announced a new partnership with state-owned Changan Automobile to build electric vehicles with battery-swapping technology. The two companies are also seeking to design joint standards for battery technology. The partnership aims to boost NIO’s profitability amid the growing competition in the sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">NIO will report its Q3 financial results </span><b>on December 5</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The consensus expectation is for revenue of $2.66B and EPS of -$0.36.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">NIO launched additional lower-priced vehicles earlier in the year, reducing average selling price and margins. But with no new launches planned for 2023, the company expects profit margins to bounce back as production scales on existing models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since receiving an investment from the Abu Dhabi government in June, NIO has sought to build positive sentiment and improve its fiscal position. Monthly delivery volumes have returned to growth in Q3 and Q4 after declining at the start of the year. NIO also raised $1 billion through a convertible bond issuance, which avoids financial pressure and adds further funds for the company’s expansion plans. There has also been a commitment to a cost-cutting program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">NIO said its cost reduction efforts would include laying off around 10% of its workforce. The company added that it would target non-performing teams and projects that have failed to meet internal targets, leading to improved future execution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With those developments, an earnings surprise could see a rally in NIO over the near term.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">One of the stock highlights of the year to date has been the Nio share price rise, something which can be appreciated by looking at the daily chart. The rise for the Chinese electric car maker of 1,000%, has not only been exceptional in terms of its magnitude, but the way it has been sustained. While rival EV maker Tesla (TSLA) has seen massive volatility, for Nio, so far, it has been a relatively smooth ride.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10549"></span></p>
<h2>Nio shares COVID-19 driver</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Of course, the 10 fold rise has been driven by what are now familiar fundamental drivers. The key one is the way that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic investors have become far more environmentally conscious, especially given that coronavirus is essentially a respiratory disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">This concern has placed renewable energy front and centre as a space of interest, with EV’s leading the way on a day to day basis. The second key backing factor for the Nio share price is clearly the origin of the company in the massive Chinese market. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">China has seen an economic resurgence since the pandemic, and the ongoing rise of the middle class market in China. A company addressing the high end car market is likely to be seen as a winner. So far this has proved to be the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">The great NIO Inc share price turnaround<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">With a market capitalisation greater than that of many of the fossil fuel players such as GM (GM), the rise and rise of Nio shares has been nothing less than phenomenal. But at the same time it has been perfectly understandable, not the usual situation for very popular rising shares.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NIO share price $1bn boost</h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Nio, which has been described as Tesla’s nemesis, does appear to justify such a tag. This is not only because of its position in the largest market in the world &#8211; China, but also the way that its product line includes a SUV and will be expanding rapidly over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Perhaps most crucially, in terms of the race of Nio shares with Tesla, the Chinese group has secured its financial position. This is quite a turnaround from the position Nio was in just a year ago, running out of cash, and with poor sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">A year on and boosted by $1bn in local Chinese funding, Nio can progress with battery innovation, and after sales services which threaten to place it well ahead of Tesla in the market place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Nio share price and the competition</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">What is clear over the past year, and especially since the pandemic began, is the way that investors are trying to bet on who will be the winner in the EV space? The key issue in this battle is who will be able to beat the opposition. In the end it may come down to the rollout of EV infrastructure such as charging points, as to the cars themselves. In this respect it could be that it is not so much Nio’s cars that will win the race, but customer service, Government subsidies, as well as leasing and financing deals. Set against this background the trend for Nio seems well entrenched for now.</span></p>
