<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41821" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="SP 500 – Daily Chart" width="967" height="588" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 967w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x182.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SP 500 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is finding resistance again at the 5,882 level and that could open up a potential correction. The first support comes in at 5,784 with further levels at the 5,680 mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recovery in chip stocks boosted the market to touch new highs Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, eased chip demand worries after it reported a better-than-expected 54% increase in Q3 net income and raised its target for 2024. Stronger-than-expected economic news on weekly jobless claims and retail sales also supported the market and improved the outlook for a soft landing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell by -19,000 to 241,000, showing a stronger labour market than expectations of an increase to 259,000. US September retail sales rose 0.4% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle East tensions continue to be a negative factor for stocks, while the upcoming election poses a risk of volatility after markets started to price in a decisive victory for Donald Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further Q3 earnings may determine the near-term direction of stocks according to Bloomberg Intelligence, with S&amp;P 500 companies expected to report an average of 4.3% from a year ago, down from the 7.9% growth projected in July. Markets are now discounting the chances for a November rate cut of 92% for 25 basis points.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">SP500 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP500</a> has broken above the July resistance level at 5,680. These new highs can lead to further gains. Investors should beware of a false breakout where a move back below 5,680 could lead to a correction.</p>
<p>Investors were optimistic that the Federal Reserve’s half-percentage-point rate cut will steer the US economy onto a “soft landing.” In contrast, others anticipate further economic data and an earnings report from delivery services giant FedEx.</p>
<p>The Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate by the most since 2008, and its first rate reduction in over four years. The Federal Open Market Committee voted by 11 to 1 to reduce the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% after it remained elevated for one year.</p>
<p>In the central bank’s statement, policymakers said they will contemplate “additional adjustments” to rates depending on “incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned against expecting a similar pace in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2%,” Powell said.</p>
<p>Projections released after the central bank’s two-day meeting showed that 10 out of 19 policymakers supported cutting rates by at least an additional half-point during the two remaining 2024 meetings. The projections also showed an extra percentage point of cuts in 2025.</p>
<p>The Fed has a reputation for not rushing any policy changes, so there’s the potential for some disappointment at later meetings, especially if the data changes. However, a weak jobs market was one of the key reasons for the interest rate cut.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 broke above key resistance, and after the much-anticipated rate cut, further catalysts will need to remain elevated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After defying gravity for months, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US stocks</a> look set for a correction after chip stocks tumbled.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40264 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="SP 500 – Daily Chart" width="868" height="607" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.webp 868w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-300x210.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-768x537.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SP 500 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP 500 index</a> sank from recent resistance to trade at 5,258. There is now a risk that spooked investors will increase their sales.</p>
<p>Stocks were sharply lower on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 posting a 2-week low and the Nasdaq 100 a 2-1/2 week low. The weakness was driven by chip stocks, which have been the big driver of the AI-driven stock market rally. Nvidia’s earnings last week failed to impress investors, and the market is now on edge.</p>
<p>Weaker-than-expected ISM manufacturing and construction spending reports from the US economy hurt stocks. There was also concern that weakness in China’s economy will continue to weigh on the global outlook. China’s own manufacturing PMI unexpectedly dropped by -0.3 to a 6-month low of 49.1, despite analysts’ expectations for a move higher to 49.5.</p>
<p>Markets will now look to the important services PMI figures for the US, and a weak number could reignite recession fears. Services are 90% of the US and are tied to consumer and business activity. Services PMI is expected to dip from 51.4 to 51.1, with the 50 level being the important line in the sand for expansion. A move toward 50 or lower could add to recent stock selling.</p>
<p>That will then focus on the latest job numbers, with the country seeing a recent downgrade in previous job additions. The market is expecting to see 160k jobs added to the economy after a 114k print last month.</p>
<p>Traders are now pricing a 100% chance for a -25 bp rate cut at the September 17-18 <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/financial-events/fomc-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOMC meeting</a> and at 38% for a -50 bp rate cut at that meeting.</p>
<p>However, further economic weakness could dampen any excitement for interest rate-fuelled expansion in the economy. After the recent surge in stock prices, the S&amp;P 500 is at risk from bad news that could create a steeper correction in the market.</p>
<p>Geopolitical risks remain with intensified fighting between Ukraine and Russia, while a ceasefire is not a reality in the Middle East at the moment. There is also the upcoming US election in November, which could see a big difference in policy depending on the winner.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">SP500 – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">SP500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> closed around 4,782, with an all-time high of approximately 4,820. The market will try to get there in January. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">US stock markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> were closed for a public holiday on Monday and will reopen on Tuesday. Stocks in the S&amp;P settled at around a 2-year high as the broader market was boosted by a supportive US Dec PPI report, raising expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The US economy is also set for an unexpected fiscal boost if lawmakers back a proposed deal for $70 billion worth of tax breaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Congress is locked in talks over renewing expired business tax breaks and boosting the child tax credit, evenly split between both. The proposal would need to pass through a Congress that is deeply divided over the nation’s fiscal situation, with some Republican lawmakers pushing for deep spending cuts to avert another government shutdown </span><b>on Jan. 19 and Feb. 2</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, when temporary funding expires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After another messy debt ceiling negotiation, the US saw its credit rating downgraded by the rating agencies in 2023. Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics, said the overall size of the tax breaks wouldn’t be enough to change her view that the Fed will cut rates in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The impact on the broader economy would be relatively small, and probably not enough to change our forecast for inflation and the Fed,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, markets are fixated on Fed tax cuts, and that could push the S&amp;P 500 higher this week with all-time highs in view. The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nasdaq</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> have already seen new highs. That is likely due to foreign investment in the prized Dow 20 and tech-heavy Nasdaq. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The markets are set to reopen positively after the Christmas trading close.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27523 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SP500-Daily-Chart-27-Dec-23.png.jpg" alt="SP500-Daily-Chart-27-Dec-23" width="778" height="553" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SP500-Daily-Chart-27-Dec-23.png.jpg 778w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SP500-Daily-Chart-27-Dec-23.png-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SP500-Daily-Chart-27-Dec-23.png-768x546.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">SP500 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SP500</a> is trading very close to the all-time high at 4,820, which will be the January target.</p>
<p>March futures for the US S&amp;P 500 were up 0.14%, and March <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq 100</a> E-Mini futures were 0.18% on Tuesday as trading resumed following the Christmas holiday. Investors are pricing in earlier and deeper interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve next year following a softer US inflation report last week.</p>
<p>In Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s indices ended mixed, with Karuna Therapeutics up 47% after Bristol Myers Squib agreed to buy the drugmaker for $14 billion in cash. However, Nike plunged around 11% after the sportswear giant reported mixed Q2 results and cautious revenue guidance for the second half.</p>
<p>Key data from the US Department of Commerce showed that the US core PCE price index, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, was 0.1% over the month and 3.2% year-over-year in November. That was softer than expectations of 0.2% monthly and 3.3% on a yearly basis. November personal spending was also higher by 0.2% over the month, while the Michigan consumer sentiment reading was revised to a 5-month high of 69.7 in December, beating expectations of 69.4.</p>
<p>“The data was very dovish, and, of course, this is the Fed’s primary measure of inflation. But the core being below expectations and the top line also being below expectations is positive for the market, indicative that inflation is declining,” said Tim Griskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls &amp; Snyder.</p>
<p>Markets are now seeing a 14% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the next central bank meeting in January but a 75% chance of a rate cut at the March FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Asian stock markets were mixed, with China’s Shanghai Composite Index down 0.68% and <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan’s Nikkei 225</a> up 0.16%. Sentiment in the Chinese market is still weak despite authorities stepping back from a video game industry crackdown. Semiconductor and gaming stocks were lower last week, but an approval of 105 domestic games on Monday boosted the outlook for the sector.</p>
<p>Japan’s central bank governor boosted the Nikkei by saying it is not rushing to end the accommodative low-interest rate policy.</p>
