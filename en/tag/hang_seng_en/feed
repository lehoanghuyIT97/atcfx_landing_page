										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hang Seng was steady on Wednesday as South Korea’s government called a no-confidence vote. Turmoil in the country has not spread to other indices. </span></p>
<p><b> <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43714" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HK50-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="HK50 – Daily Chart" width="967" height="531" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HK50-–-Daily-Chart.png 967w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HK50-–-Daily-Chart-300x165.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HK50-–-Daily-Chart-768x422.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">HK50 – Daily Chart </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HK50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is hovering below 20,000 and that will be the target by the end of the week. Previous resistance lies at 21,000 ahead of the January 2023 high of 22,719. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US employment numbers from ADP failed to dent the S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday. After surging 233k higher in October (the largest jump since July 2023), expectations were for a slowdown in November to 150k. The reality was much worse with the previous number downgraded to 184k and November&#8217;s coming in lower at 146k. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While overall growth for the month was healthy, industry performance was mixed,&#8221; said Nela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Manufacturing was the weakest we&#8217;ve seen since spring. Financial services and leisure and hospitality were also soft&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attention now turns to Friday’s NFP payrolls data, which could confirm the ADP weakness. That could be a reason to avoid being too long into the weekend on stocks as the number is released late Friday in Hong Kong. After more record highs in US markets this week, there could be a correction ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US markets were awaiting a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell which will come ahead of the Asian session on Thursday. “The Fed has been quite clear up until now in their signaling, so if they were going to pause Powell might give some signals because they won’t want to surprise the market,” said Guy Miller, chief strategist at Zurich Insurance. “But I do think they will cut by 25 basis points this month,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol now faces an impeachment proceeding after the shortest period of martial law in history. The President had the support of only 25% of voters after various personal scandals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Won has since stabilised and there was no risk of contagion across other Asian markets. Chinese stocks eased by 0.42% on the day after China&#8217;s services activity expanded at a slower pace in November, due to easing new business growth. Stocks in the country are giving up some of the recent gains which have led to two-week highs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, losses were limited after the People&#8217;s Bank of China extended its support for the yuan by setting its daily reference rate higher.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent surge in Chinese stocks hit resistance and saw some profit-taking in the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41506" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart.png" alt="HK 50 - Daily Chart" width="1120" height="583" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart.png 1120w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart-300x156.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart-1024x533.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">HK 50 &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HK 50 index</a> fell to 20.926 after being rejected by resistance at the Feb 2023 high of 22,691. The market moved very fast and stretched too far from the 20-day moving average at 19,344.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/hk-share-cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stocks</a> tumbled 9.4% in Hong Kong for the worst day since the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/financial-events/2008-financial-crisis-3-causes-3-effects-3-lessons-learned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2008 global financial crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Shenzhen markets reopened with a bang on Tuesday, as turnover topped 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) in the first 20 minutes of the session. That pushed the blue-chip CSI 300 index up 10% initially. However, a sharp selloff in Hong Kong quickly dampened the mood among investors.</p>
<p>Despite the recent volatility, the CSI300 is up by around 25% since the government announced a set of monetary stimulus to prop up equity and property markets.</p>
<p>Valuations still look cheap at only 11 times forward earnings, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, and below the 20 times currently for Indian stocks. Also, at the end of August, mutual funds were at their lowest Chinese equity allocation in the past decade. Many analysts are gloomy about the prospects due to previous slowing in the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>But the real issue is that the Chinese government has committed to strong stimulus and that should start to see foreign investors return. The 10% stock market drops on Tuesday were driven by the speculative swing higher, and the market will now look for buyers to return at lower levels.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs raised their forecasts on the MSCI China Index and they now expect total returns of around 15% from current levels. Other investment banks, such as Morgan Stanley, believe the central government will soon announce a 2 trillion yuan fiscal package in the coming weeks, while a state-run think tank official has suggested something closer to 10 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>There was no mention of any further action at a press conference held by the National Development &amp; Reform Commission on Tuesday, which hurt stocks. But a large package of that level would likely lead to another run up in stocks once a floor is reached which may not be far from current levels after sharp selling from overbought conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent Chinese stimulus measures have set a potential low for the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang Seng index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41102" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HK-50-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="HK 50 – Weekly Chart" width="925" height="604" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HK-50-–-Weekly-Chart.png 925w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HK-50-–-Weekly-Chart-300x196.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HK-50-–-Weekly-Chart-768x501.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">HK 50 – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HK 50 has rallied from another test of the support at 16,842 and the market now has a chance to move higher to the 22,764 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short covering may have driven some of the recent sharp rally in </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/hk-share-cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after China’s central bank unveiled a broad package of measures, JPMorgan Chase analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s short sales ratio as a percentage of total market trading dipped to 13.6% on Tuesday from 15% to 22% last week, Wendy Liu wrote. That brings the ratio to one standard deviation below the market average since 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is a sign that any outsized short positions have now been covered and buyers can be the dominant group in the weeks ahead. It is unlikely that shorts will return when the PBoC has drawn a line in the sand with economic weakness. Chinese authorities had looked for the market to find its own recovery but have lost patience and stepped in to support corporations and homeowners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong stocks surged for a fourth day on record trading volume, reclaiming the 20,000 level and registering the best week in 26 years after a buying frenzy. The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.6% to 20,632 as of Friday. That was the highest level since April 2023 and created a 13% gain on the week.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the best weekly performance since the 14.9% rise in October 1998 and added more than US$440 billion in market value to domestic stocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total transaction volume in the market surged to HK$445 billion (US$57 billion) on Friday, the highest on record, according to Bloomberg. Technology stocks rallied 5.8% as the Shanghai Composite Index jumped to a four-month high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have seen one of the busiest periods from our clients in recent years across Asian equities, and notably across mainland China and Hong Kong stocks,&#8221; said Paul Smith, Citi&#8217;s head of markets for Asia and Australia. &#8220;These latest measures have provided fresh impetus into the market, and we see it continuing given ongoing investor interest.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hang Seng rally has driven away short sellers and they are unlikely to return after the PBoC telegraphed further rate cuts and stimulus.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37535" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="HK 50 – Daily Chart" width="976" height="639" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart.png 976w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart-300x196.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart-768x503.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">HK 50 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HK 50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw a correction after the May breakout of strong downtrend resistance. A rally has now formed, with the price now trading at 18,293, and the index will look to push toward the 20,000 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week&#8217;s softer-than-expected US inflation reading boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property stocks were mainly supported, with Sun Hung Kai Properties and other Hong Kong-based developers rallying on the prospect that the rate cut would revive home sales in the region. The Hong Kong dollar&#8217;s peg to the US dollar means the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has to raise or cut the city&#8217;s benchmark interest rate in lockstep with the Fed&#8217;s rate changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank stock earnings in the United States also hinted at a slowdown in consumer spending and stress among borrowers. That could feed into further rate cuts, and the US stock rallied on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese economy&#8217;s growth figures will be released on Monday, which could also boost stocks. The forecast is for 5.1% after 5.3% last month, but there is still potential for a better-than-expected result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s ruling party also starts its third plenum meeting this week to discuss the outlook for the economy. That could bring positive news for the market with the potential for further property market reforms or support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese authorities also suspended short-selling in the stock market last week, which could help stock prices in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will also be little data from the United States in the week ahead. However, a European interest rate decision may affect the dollar.</span></p>

This trend is crucial for our understanding of the current market dynamics.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35578" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="HK 50 – Daily Chart" width="1008" height="585" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 1008w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x174.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">HK 50 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HK 50 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spiked above resistance at the 18,938 level but has since slumped back and trades below a lower resistance at 18,385. These are the two markers if the price wants to return to the psychological 20,000 mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most intriguing developments is the doubling of southbound inflows under the Stock Connect scheme in 2024, reaching a staggering $321 billion, a figure that piques our curiosity about the potential future market trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The strong rally, which began in late January, came amid strong inflows from southbound investors,&#8221; HSI said. &#8220;Notably, if the monthly net inflows remained positive by the end of June, it would mark the 12th consecutive month of positive net inflows for southbound investment.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financials were the favourite sector, with 31%, followed by technology stocks at 22% and energy at 18%. The energy sector also saw its most considerable weighting increase, up from 13% last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese stocks may have seen their rally relaxed off, but billionaire US investor David Tepper is still a fan. Through his Appaloosa Management hedge fund, Tepper increased his stake in online retailer PDD Holdings by almost 171%. The billionaire investor also increased his Baidu stake by 188%, adding a new position in JD.com. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tepper&#8217;s most significant investment came in Alibaba Group, where he bought 6.9 new shares in Q1. The company is now his largest holding, worth $814 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support from US value investors could continue as</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> press all-time highs, and mainland China support will likely build over time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32876" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HK50-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="HK50 – Daily Chart" width="967" height="606" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HK50-–-Daily-Chart.png 967w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HK50-–-Daily-Chart-300x188.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HK50-–-Daily-Chart-768x481.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">HK50 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HK50 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has broken above 18,385 and now looks at higher resistance levels. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/hk-share-cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extended their gains towards an eight-month high after mainland traders, returning from a five-day holiday, added to recent inflows, fueling optimism. Strong travel data and positive calls from investment banks further lifted the mood, indicating a positive outlook for the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, investors from the US are seeing Hong Kong as a diversification opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, UBS, and BNP Paribas, have become more positive on Chinese stocks. Foreign investors jumped in for a third month in April when China&#8217;s State Council issued new guidelines to support the $9 trillion stock market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential ceasefire in the Middle East also supports the price of stocks globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next major catalyst for Hong Kong stocks, which could drive the market further, comes from consumer indicators. Preliminary consumer data on Chinese travel over the &#8220;golden week&#8221; holiday shows robustness in travel. Flight booking volumes hit a post-Covid record, and intercity mobility has surged. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the March consumer confidence index has reached a one-year high, promising for the market&#8217;s future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market is now focused on the first green shoots of growth in mainland China and Hong Kong. Economic growth in both markets is coming in higher than expected, and global growth appears to be re-accelerating, with hints of peace in the Middle East. We are still far from the levels seen in Hong Kong&#8217;s equity boom, but the path has been unclear for years.</span></p>

<p><b> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32797" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HK50-Daily-Chart.png" alt="HK50 - Daily Chart" width="940" height="654" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HK50-Daily-Chart.png 940w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HK50-Daily-Chart-300x209.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HK50-Daily-Chart-768x534.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">HK50 &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the HK 50 index has initial resistance ahead at the 18,379 level after a sharp rally over the last week. A breakout here could lead to a move for the</span> 20,000<span style="font-weight: 400;"> level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang Seng Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was up 2.5% on Thursday, marking a technical bull market, even with mainland Chinese buyers on holiday. The Hang Seng Tech Index surged 4.4%, while property developers and casino operators also fared well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang Seng&#8217;s strong performance comes after global money managers adjusted their portfolios according to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy path. Hopes of early rate cuts have disappeared, and Hong Kong&#8217;s dollar peg makes the country&#8217;s stocks attractive to overseas managers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Global investors take profit from US, Japanese or global tech holdings and move into Chinese stocks to capitalise on a swift rebound,&#8221; said Richard Tang at Julius Baer. &#8220;Traditionally, Hong Kong stocks see higher participation from global investors and this is likely to drive its near-term outperformance over the A-share market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FOMC held US interest rates steady on Wednesday, and Chair Jerome Powell said that inflation was still too high. Comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said that the country&#8217;s budget deficit was a headwind and would need attention. That could lead to efforts to stabilise the fiscal outlook and the US dollar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese investors have been a significant driver of Hong Kong stocks, with inflows from the mainland last month making up a third of all turnover, the highest on record. Chinese investors have already bought HK$213 billion of Hong Kong this year, which is two-thirds of last year&#8217;s total, and last week marked net inflows for 22 straight sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hang Seng is looking to test some initial resistance, but the rally could continue if inflow trends keep up.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hang Seng is poised at an important long-term level, and a potential breakout higher could pave the way for a significant long-term , offering a promising outlook for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-31923 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/HK50-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="HK50 – Daily Chart" width="886" height="595" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/HK50-–-Daily-Chart.png 886w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/HK50-–-Daily-Chart-300x201.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/HK50-–-Daily-Chart-768x516.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" /><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">HK50 – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HK50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, currently trading at 16,723, has demonstrated resilience by finding a double bottom at the 16,000 level. The support at the late-2020 dip remains in play, with a more robust downtrend resistance line at around 17,000. A push above that level can propel the market towards the 20,000 level again, showcasing its stability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian stocks were lower on Friday, alongside a broader retreat in Asian markets, after hawkish comments from a Federal Reserve official reduced bets on an interest-rate cut as early as June this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hang Seng Index weakened by less than 0.1% on Friday, and selling pressure has eased, regardless of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s moves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong jobs report disappointed rate cut bettors on Friday, and stubborn inflation may close the door on US rate cuts this year, according to Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we continue to see inflation moving sideways, then that would make me question whether we need to do those rate cuts at all,&#8221; said Kashkari, who last month projected two rate cuts in 2024. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of momentum in the economy right now.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the CME Group based on Fed fund futures, the expectation for a rate cut at the Fed&#8217;s June meeting stands at 54.3% as of Friday, compared with 61.8% on Thursday. US consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 3.2% in February, up from 3.1% in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hang Seng may fluctuate depending on the rate of cut obsession. However, holding the current support levels and breaking above the downtrend resistance could lead to a rally in </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/hk--cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A break above the 17,000 level would be a good start for the index.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27322 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HSI-–-Weekly-Chart-1.jpg" alt="HSI – Weekly Chart" width="703" height="516" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HSI-–-Weekly-Chart-1.jpg 703w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HSI-–-Weekly-Chart-1-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">HSI – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The Hang Seng has been testing a key level from 2022 over the last two weeks, which provides weekly resistance. A strong weekly gain above 16,842-17,000 could see the index power higher to the downtrend resistance at 18,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/hk-share-cfd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hong Kong stocks</a> were boosted by a leadership change at Alibaba to strengthen its e-commerce business. After the company reshuffled its executives, Alibaba climbed to the highest level since November. According to an internal memo, PDD Holdings continued to attack its market share.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reshuffle is aimed at finding new growth driver for its e-commerce business that&#8217;s been battered by rivals including from live-streaming platforms,&#8221; said Dai Ming at Huichen Asset Management. &#8220;On the other hand, Alibaba may also start to adjust its sprawling investment portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hong Kong traders also have to consider the path of the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/market-news/us-dollar-economic-data-fed-driven-slump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US dollar after the Federal Reserve hinted at rate cuts</a> as the following likely path. That has spurred record levels in the Nasdaq and <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/dow-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones</a>, with the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> only 0.60% away.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng also got support from Chinese economic numbers, showing that the economy was turning. In a report, the National Bureau of Statistics said that the country&#8217;s retail sales rose 10.1% in November. The country&#8217;s unemployment rate remained at 5.0% while industrial production rose by 6.6%, marking the fastest growth over two years. The industrial production outpaced the median estimate of 5.6%.</p>
<p>A strong weekly close this week could lead to a follow-through rally into year-end and set the stage for 2024 gains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A positive day in the Hang Seng on Monday gives trades hope for the week ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26011" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HANG-SENG-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="HANG SENG – Weekly Chart" width="711" height="577" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HANG-SENG-–-Weekly-Chart.png 711w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HANG-SENG-–-Weekly-Chart-300x243.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">HANG SENG – Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/hk-share-cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hang Seng</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> closed at 17,426. The 16,842 level held stocks up in November last year and may again support a push to 19,000 or 20,000. A breakdown below that level could lead to a retest of the lows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wall Street optimism helped to lift Asian shares on Monday, and a Moody’s downgrade of US debt on Friday is another potential boost for Asian investment. The ratings agency downgraded the country from AAA to AA+, citing the debt ceiling arguments and debt affordability. It is the third ratings downgrade for the world’s largest economy this year after Fitch and Standard and Poor’s did the same. The White House disagreed with the move. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was also a weak treasury auction last week as fears over supply hit the market.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;there has been a material deterioration in liquidity in US Treasuries. The Bloomberg measure of Treasury market liquidity based off persistent dislocations from fair value is at an extreme right now,” ING analysts said </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But China’s economy is also weak after slipping back into deflation last month, dragged lower by falling pork prices as policymakers struggled to reignite domestic demand. The consumer price index fell by 0.2 percent year over year in October, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday, compared with a 0.1 percent fall forecast by a Reuters poll of analysts. The CPI was unchanged in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">China struggles to lure foreign investors back as data shows more direct investment flowing out of the country than coming in. Companies may diversify their supply chains to reduce risks. Foreign direct investment fell by $11.8 billion from July to September, marking </span><b>the first contraction since records began in 1998</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hong Kong has lowered its annual economic growth forecast, indicating a challenging macro environment. The revision comes after the city reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter GDP growth, highlighting economic challenges despite a recent tourism revival.</span></p>
