										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were dumped on Wednesday after the company’s auditor resigned. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42302" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SMCI-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SMCI - Daily Chart" width="1087" height="606" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SMCI-Daily-Chart.png 1087w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SMCI-Daily-Chart-300x167.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SMCI-Daily-Chart-1024x571.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SMCI-Daily-Chart-768x428.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1087px) 100vw, 1087px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SMCI &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of SMCI has slumped from resistance near the $50 level and has pushed lower to $33. The early market action showed SMCI opening at $31 and a $30 test is likely. Larger resistance comes in at $22.85. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The share price is now down almost 40% after the company’s auditor Ernst &amp; Young resigned. The company had problems in late August after delaying the filing of its annual report, as it needed to assess &#8220;its internal controls over financial reporting&#8221;. That followed a negative short report from Hindenburg Research which disclosed a short position accusing the company of &#8220;accounting manipulation&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro said on Wednesday that EY had raised concerns about its governance, transparency, and financial reporting. The auditor then appointed a special committee to investigate the matter. The accounting firm has now resigned after receiving additional information from the review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management&#8217;s and the Audit Committee&#8217;s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management,&#8221; EY said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro said it disagreed with the accounting firm&#8217;s decision and does not expect the &#8220;resolution of any matters raised by EY&#8221; to result in problems with the quarterly reports for fiscal 2024 or prior years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro was a big winner from the generative AI boom as businesses ramped up spending to power new applications. The company saw its market value surging from around $4.4 billion at the beginning of 2023 to a March peak of $67 billion, before suffering a drop in recent months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As far as auditor statements go, E&amp;Y&#8217;s SMCI resignation letter is about as strongly worded as I have seen,&#8221; the founder of Hindenburg said on X after hearing the news. The Wall Street Journal reported in late September that the US Department of Justice was also investigating Super Micro over claims that it supplied chips to countries that were on a US sanctions list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro now releases its latest earnings next week and that could add further volatility to the shares.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares in </span><b>Super Micro Computer (NYSE:SMCI)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were 5% lower on Tuesday despite some stronger sales data. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41505" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SMCI-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SMCI - Daily Chart" width="918" height="598" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SMCI-Daily-Chart.png 918w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SMCI-Daily-Chart-300x195.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SMCI-Daily-Chart-768x500.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SMCI &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMCI shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rallied to around the $50 level, but have since pulled back to $45.35. This is an important level as a failure to get back above $47.99 would be bearish.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it now ships over 100,000 GPUs per quarter and has delivered more than 2,000 liquid-cooled racks since June 2024. The company’s stock was initially boosted by the news. The company’s advanced cooling technology can manage servers of 12kW of power for AI and high-performance workloads, with a single AI rack now capable of generating over 100 kW of heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquid cooling  has allowed the company to become an important provider of AI hardware, especially as demand outpaces supply at the likes of Nvidia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMCI completed a 10-for-1 stock split recently, which companies often do when their share prices rise and become unappealing to retail investors. After trading near $416 per share, the company now trades in the $40s after the split. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is still a dark cloud surrounding the company after an investigation from the US DoJ (Department of Justice). This came after a report by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, which accused the company of account malpractice and highlighted a rise in sales to Russia, which is a sanctioned country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the company’s report surrounding June chip sales, they will have to provide investors with a solid </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after delaying their recent filing a matter of days after the short seller accusations. The weakness in the stock highlights continued concerns by investors.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of SMCI fell 23% on Friday and may attract value investors. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32419" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SMCI-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SMCI – Daily Chart" width="913" height="619" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SMCI-–-Daily-Chart.png 913w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SMCI-–-Daily-Chart-300x203.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SMCI-–-Daily-Chart-768x521.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SMCI – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMCI has some support at the $700 level and may attract investors looking for a bounce to the $872 resistance level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro&#8217;s management told investors on Friday that the company will release earnings on 30 April. Traders were worried that they did not pre-release the numbers at that time. The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been on a big AI-fuelled rally this year and has since given up some gains. There has also been a cooling in other AI-related chipmakers, such as ASML, which is down 11% over the last week following its earnings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some may see it as a buying opportunity before the earnings release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s results for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 saw them beat estimates for revenue and earnings. Net sales doubled to $3.66 billion from $1.80 billion a year ago due to new customer additions. Earnings per share of $5.59 were also up 71.5% year-over-year. They have also beaten EPS estimates in four of the last five quarters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro&#8217;s growth has been driven by its ability to customise its server products according to its customers&#8217; requirements. This gives the company an advantage over some of its competition and helps it time the artificial intelligence hype well. The company has good relations with Silicon Valley manufacturers, giving them an edge. Super Micro&#8217;s specialised servers and storage products are essential to building AI tools like ChatGPT or Google&#8217;s Gemini. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That should keep the company&#8217;s products in demand over the coming years. Despite the recent losses, SMCI is still up by 156% year-to-date.</span></p>
