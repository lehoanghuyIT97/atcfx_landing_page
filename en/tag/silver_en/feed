<p style="text-align: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47442 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart.png" alt="xagusd,silver,spot" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart.png 840w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">XAGUSD &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p>The price of XAGUSD is approaching recent resistance at $34.20 and a breakout higher could another leg to the rally.</p>
<p>In recent months, there has been a drive to bring physical silver onshore to the United States, leading to a sharp rise in COMEX inventories, which are 60% higher since December.</p>
<p>While the official explanation points to potential tariffs from the Trump administration on imported silver, there may be other reasons for the scramble. Further confirming the scramble for physical silver has been a surge in trading volume since December in the Sprott Physical Silver Trust, the most well-known physically backed silver exchange-traded product. The non-physically backed iShares Silver Trust has been flat over the same period, highlighting a clear investor preference for products backed by real silver.</p>
<p>Another reason for the recent surge is that <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold has hit new highs</a> this year. Over the past year, gold has outperformed, while silver has lagged, but the dynamic may be about to shift. Silver remains deeply undervalued relative to gold, and a correction in that dynamic may be imminent.</p>
<p>With gold now holding the level above the key $3,000 psychological level, the bias remains to the upside. This continued bullish momentum in gold should create a strong tailwind for silver moving forward.</p>
<p>Silver’s outlook is increasingly tied to the inflation narrative playing out in the global economy. President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, set to take effect April 2, are widely expected to boost import prices. Economists estimate the inflation impact could exceed a full percentage point, while Fed officials anticipate a temporary spike, others warn of longer-lasting pressure, adding uncertainty to interest rate decisions​​.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">XAGUSD &#8211; Weekly Chart</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silver’s</a> all-time high is near the $50 set in 2011. The price is still 50% away from that high, and the first resistance is at the $26 level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold prices</a> continued to soar in 2023, with the current $2,080 price above the $1,921 high in 2011.</p>
<p>From the pandemic to Ukraine and Gaza, gold prices have risen as geopolitical events have stressed global markets. Alongside that, Western governments continue on their unsustainable debt and spending path. With that dynamic, fast-growing nations such as China and India have been stocking up on their supply of gold, buying record levels in 2022 and another buying boom in 2023.</p>
<p>The trend is also moving down to retail buyers, with the Costco supermarket in the US saying it sold $100 million worth of gold bars in the recent quarter. Some investors were worried about the potential for runaway inflation. The potential of central bank interest rate cuts is now boosting gold.</p>
<p>But the key reason silver underperforms is that gold is seen as the first-mover due to smart money, such as hedge funds or investment funds, stocking up in the early stages of stress. Silver is more of a retail buyer&#8217;s commodity in coins and smaller weighted bars.</p>
<p>Silver would catch up to gold if there were a rush to acquire precious metals in a debt-driven event with governments. The United States debt levels and the constant debt-ceiling arguments indicate that the day may come when silver goes on a big price run.</p>
<p>Metal will also continue to be necessary for electric vehicles and solar power, among other industries. If gold continues to push higher, silver can break above its early resistance in the year ahead. A more serious <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/financial-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial event</a> could see it returning to all-time highs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Silver XAGUSD – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The silver price is testing an uptrend support line at $23.00, and there is further support at the $22.00 level.</p>
<p>Another problem for bullion investors is the drop in inflation seen across developed nations. Many investors were buying<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/markets/commodities" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">precious metals</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to hedge against inflation, but the peak in inflation near double digits for many countries has stalled.</p>
<p>The United States saw a seasonal tick higher to 3.2% from 3% in its annual inflation rate, but core inflation fell to 4.7%. Analysts are still discussing a long way to go for the Federal Reserve, but at 3.2%, inflation is only 1.2% away from the central bank&#8217;s 2% target.</p>
<p>&#8220;Markets are doubling down on &#8216;soft landing&#8217; bets this morning after US consumer inflation slowed as expected, reducing the need for further monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve,&#8221; wrote Karl Schamotta at Corpay.</p>
<p>Further data on Thursday showed claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week. Economists had forecast 230,000 claims for the latest week, a sign that the booming jobs market is stalling.</p>
<p>Markets are now pricing a high chance of a Fed rate hike pause again in September, but they may be done with their hiking policy.</p>
<p>There are still beneficial dynamics for silver supply, with the World Silver Survey 2023 saying the silver market has been in deficit for the last two years. The deficit in 2022 was 237.7 million ounces, while the 2023 deficit is forecast to be 142.1 million ounces.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that will continue with the drive to green energy policies and the need for solar panels and electric vehicles.</p>
