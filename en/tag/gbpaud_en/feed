										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reserve Bank of Australia releases its latest monetary policy comments and UK employment figures are also set for release. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48023" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPAUD – Daily Chart" width="847" height="514" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png 847w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-300x182.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-768x466.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPAUD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week brought selling to </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPAUD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it could be a sign that the recent rally is exhausted. Previous resistance at 2 would be a target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBA releases its meeting minutes at 9:30am HKT and traders will look for clues on the next monetary policy path for Australia. An election looms in the country and it is likely that the bank will wait for that to pass before making any monetary statements. The UK has employment data ahead at 2pm HKT with a 4.4% employment rate expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia held its cash rate at the 4.1% level recently. Australian homeowners were given a boost in February with a rate cut but governor Michele Bullock delivered a hold amid what she described as an &#8220;uncertain&#8221; outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian election is set for May 3 and we will likely see further patience from the bank. The central bank will probably make some comments on the tariff situation which threatens to affect the export-led economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK economy posted growth of 0.5% in February in a boost to the current government after several months of stagnation. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) noted “widespread growth” across multiple sectors in its report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data back in January saw an unexpected 0.1% decline and was reported before the ONS revised its estimates to a flat month, following just 0.1% in the final quarter of 2024. Economists will be keen to see continued growth in the country in the months ahead.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v AUD exchange rate will have data released on Wednesday from the Australian and British economies. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47238" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPAUD – Daily Chart" width="774" height="540" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png 774w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-300x209.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-768x536.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPAUD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPAUD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has found some initial resistance at the 2.06 level and is set to test the previous high at 2.30 if data is not supportive to the British pound. That could open up a move back into the previous range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer price data is set to be released at 8:30am on Wednesday for the Australian economy with analysts expecting a 2.5% growth figure. The cost-of-living is a hot topic in the upcoming Australian election as food and energy prices remain elevated in the country, alongside higher interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further data for the GBP v AUD pair is released at 3pm HKT with consumer prices for the UK. The current annual pace is 2.9% in the country, which is still above the central bank’s 2% target.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, the cost-of-living crisis is being driven by the new government taxation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in 2023 that his party would freeze council tax, but bills are now 25% higher than in 2021-22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rival party spokesman said: &#8220;This is Starmer&#8217;s day of shame. It is clear that taxes are only going one way on his watch because of decisions he&#8217;s made”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Australia, an upcoming Federal budget is expected to provide relief for households. The budget is expected to push a &#8220;buy Australian&#8221; plan to support local businesses from the economic disruptions of tariffs. Australian beef and pharmaceuticals are expected to be targeted in the next round of US tariffs expected next week. The budget will also contain a further $10.6 billion for defense spending over four years.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Australia and the UK are ramping up defense spending but expecting the struggling consumer to foot the bill and the economies are struggling for growth.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47079" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GBPAUD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPAUD - Daily Chart" width="838" height="558" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GBPAUD-Daily-Chart.png 838w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GBPAUD-Daily-Chart-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GBPAUD-Daily-Chart-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPAUD &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBP v AUD is hovering above the 2.03 level and that now becomes key support for any further gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first release comes early at 8:30am HKT with the Aussie employment rate. Markets expect a gain of 30k jobs after 44k last month. The UK releases its own jobs figures at 3pm HKT with traders expecting to see an improvement on last month’s 107k jobs added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK exchange rate is advancing over the Aussie dollar as traders factor in the tariff situation. Trump’s tariffs threaten Australia’s economic rebound with fears that a coming trade war could increase the nation’s rate of business closures. Australia’s economy is now expected to grow at 2.2% in 2025, according to Westpac bank and the Melbourne Institute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be an improvement on the 1.3% growth recorded in 2024 and better than the 1.9% figure that was predicted for 2025 by the OECD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would still be slower than Australia’s average growth rate of 2.5-3%, Westpac’s head of macro forecasting Matt Hassan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Importantly, the component detail suggests the improved growth pulse is more fragile than it looks,” he said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Much of the gain reflects a firming in </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prices and a lower Australian dollar that may now be largely behind us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tailwinds may slow, while the tariffs will likely become a significant headwind for economic activity in Australia, Hassan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are already struggling to pay their trading partners because of tough economic conditions, with CreditorWatch’s February Business Risk Index recording a 47% increase in invoice payment defaults during the last 12 months to February 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK is also struggling and the current government is abandoning its socialist roots by slashing benefits. The Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has outlined major changes to the benefits system which is aimed at saving £5bn ($6bn) by 2030. The amount of people claiming sickness or disability has risen from 2.8m to 4m across England and Wales since the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound has been rising against the Aussie dollar due to interest rate expectations but the upside may be limited due to the UK’s economic struggles. That is being balanced by the fact that the Australian dollar is more susceptible to US tariffs.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45868" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="GBPAUD – Daily Chart" width="904" height="577" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 904w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x191.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x490.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPAUD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v AUD price is trading just below the 2 level and that is important as it was the high in 2023. Coming data from the two economies could see this as a breakout, or correction barrier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBA interest rate decision and press conference starts at 11:30am HKT. Australia’s central bank is set to cut interest rates for the first time in four years despite inflationary pressures from global trade tariffs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey expect the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to finally start easing today with a 25-basis-point reduction in the cash rate to 4.1%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be the RBA’s first cut since November 2020 and could be a boost for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who needs to overcome weakness in the polls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money markets are pricing in an 85% chance of a cut, but gains in consumer spending, aided by tax cuts and government subsidies, may convince policymakers to stay cautious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBA’s policy has been similar to major economies as it didn’t tighten as aggressively in 2022 and 2023. The board attempted to hold onto labour market gains while bringing inflation back to target, but that has drawn criticism and many will welcome some rate relief. Price pressures are reducing at a quicker pace than the bank anticipated, according to data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I were still at the RBA, I’d struggle to write a board paper justifying rates on hold given how much inflation has come down, given the likely near-term trajectory and given how much the RBA is going to have to revise its forecasts in the new round,” said Luci Ellis, chief economist at Westpac Banking Corp.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hard to know how much they’ll pivot their language,” Ellis said. “However, this is not a big cutting cycle. We really think they’ve got at most 100 basis points”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westpac’s Ellis and Commonwealth Bank’s Gareth Aird, see a 20% probability the RBA takes no Tuesday action. Another factor for the RBA is that the Australian dollar has fallen more than 5% since the US election in November, leading to price increases for imports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On employment, Australia’s jobless rate stayed low in December while vacancies remain high, suggesting unemployment could fall further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United Kingdom, employment data at 3pm HKT is expected to show an increase in unemployment to 4.5% from 4.4%. Last month’s +35k jobs may not be better as the economy struggles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v AUD will look for direction around the 2.000 level which may come from the RBA decision and statements.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45489" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPAUD – Daily Chart" width="834" height="562" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png 834w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-300x202.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-768x518.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPAUD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v AUD is testing the resistance level at 1.9975 and a failure here could take the pair back to 1.86. Any GBP strength could create a breakout situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data starts on Thursday at 8:30am HKT with Australian trade balance figures and analysts expecting a $7 billion figure, down from $7.079 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK data comes later at 8pm HKT with the Bank of England interest rate meeting. The actions by the BoE may be predicted but any change could lead to a new trend developing over the next week or two. Regardless of the bank’s decision, the press conference could change the ideas of investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to factor in the recent stresses over the UK’s budget and finances. </span></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will the BoE announce a larger-than-expected rate cut to help the government? </span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain is struggling from a lack of growth and employment. The recent tax threat only adds to the problem and many key bills, such as energy, water, and council tax are all set to rise sharply in the coming months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower borrowing costs can help the government and support growth and employment, partially offsetting the reaction to the budget. Financial markets and economists are currently pricing in three interest rate cuts by the Bank of England this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian economy may be at risk from China tariffs from the Trump administration.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia’s Judo Bank PMI data rose to 51.1 in January from 50.2 in December, highlighting modest growth in private sector activity. The Judo Bank Services PMI rose to 51.2 from 50.8, marking the twelfth consecutive month of expansion in the services sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aussie dollar may depreciate further with the increased likelihood that the Reserve Bank of Australia could make another rate cut in February. The RBA has maintained the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 4.35% since November 2023, with policymakers suggesting that inflation must “sustainably” return to its 2%-3% target range before any policy change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v AUD is hitting resistance and a correction is possible.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPAUD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Daily Chart </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v AUD has slipped below some key resistance-turned-support and is at risk of a move lower toward the 1.93 area in the coming weeks. The 2.0 level has the potential for a medium-term high if the UK finances deteriorate with further tax hikes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data on Tuesday comes in the form of Aussie Westpac consumer data for January at 8:30am HKT. The indicator slipped by -0.2% in the month of December and economists will want an improvement. Australia’s household recession has continued for a seventh consecutive quarter, with economists blaming weaker wage growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 4:30pm, the market will have a speech from the BoE’s Sarah Braden. The UK central bank’s policy maker brushed off last week’s jump in gilt bond yields and said she is willing to continue with further cuts to interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite recent moves, investors reduced their bets on the pace of interest rate cuts by the bank on Monday. Interest rate futures are now pricing about 43 basis points of reductions to the BoE&#8217;s Bank Rate by December 2025, with 2 cuts of 25bps expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are bracing for more inflation pressures in the United States when Donald Trump becomes president and starts his </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/trump-economic-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US-centric policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The market may also see higher rates as the answer to attract bond investment after recent panic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK Prime Minister said he has “full confidence” in his Chancellor, saying she was doing a “fantastic job” but declined to say she would remain in place for his full term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound hit a fresh 14-month low and the UK’s bond yield rose to 4.9%. The 30-year bond is at a 27-year high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors should keep an eye on the pound over the coming days and weeks as any changes to policy could see sharp volatility increases.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44161" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPAUD – Daily Chart" width="742" height="576" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png 742w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-300x233.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPAUD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of GBPAUD has been looking to secure a support level at the spike high seen above the 2 level. That will be an important test in the days ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDP growth data will be released for the British economy on Monday at 3pm HKT. Analysts are expecting a year-on-year 1% return and a monthly growth figure of 0.1%. However, the recent Bank of England meeting said that there would be 0% growth in the next two quarters and the pound may find it hard to sustain the price gains above the 2 level vs the Aussie dollar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian economy has data on Tuesday with Reserve Bank of Australia meeting minutes released at 8:30am HKT. A positive spin for the RBA could see a medium-term top in the GBP v AUD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Loans founder Mark Bouris called on the RBA to cut interest rates at its next meeting in February, warning fellow Aussies that a recession was looming. He argued that continued high rates could aggravate economic conditions and lead to a full-blown recession. He said that interest rates needed to be raised to fight inflation, but had served their purpose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But now, the negative impacts of high interest rates outweigh the benefits,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“High interest rates have slowed the economy to the point whereby we’re on the verge of a full-blown recession”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBA left its cash rate on hold at 4.35% in its last board meeting for 2024 while stressing that an underlying inflation rate of 3.5% was still too far from its 2 to 3% target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a slowing economy, the UK is likely to see rates cut again and the pound may find it hard to continue the recent run against the Aussie currency.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s economic data will test the recent pullback in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPAUD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange rate.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39265" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPAUD – Daily Chart" width="937" height="637" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png 937w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-300x204.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-768x522.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPAUD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v AUD recently surged to the 2.000 level and was rejected. A bounce is in play toward resistance at 1.9600 but could continue on the correction trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first data set on Thursday is at 9:30 am HKT with Australian employment data. The country added 50.2k jobs last month, and analysts now expect 20k.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unemployment rate has been grinding higher over the last 12 months. In June 2023, it was 3.5%, but a year later, it was 4.1%. The Reserve Bank also expects that figure to keep rising from here, with a forecast of 4.3% by the end of the year and 4.4% </span><b>by June next year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian Bureau of Statistics will also release new data on average weekly earnings and overseas arrivals and departures. The RBA has held its monetary policy steady since November. The bank sees the current cash rate of 4.35% as restrictive enough to bring inflation down while preserving employment gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will be followed at 2 pm HKT by the latest United Kingdom growth figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second quarter preliminary figure is expected to jump from 0.3% to 0.9%. However, annual data is expected to be 0.8% from 1.4%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation data on Wednesday has helped the case for further rate cuts in the UK, with a smaller rise in monthly inflation figures. Analysts had been expecting a price rise from 2% to 2.3%, which could force a pause from the Bank of England.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2.2% figure was less than expected and will not cause alarm at the central bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to economists, the European Central Bank is expected to cut its benchmark rate once each quarter through the end of next year. The economy also saw inflation rise to 2.6%, but economists expect further rate cuts this year.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPAUD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPAUD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found resistance above 1.94 last week and then dropped back sharply. With the price at previous levels, a push to 1.92 is possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Franklin Templeton&#8217;s head of European bonds said that the US will have to cut rates sooner than many think. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have been more constructive on the UK, we think they probably do need to cut rates sooner than the others,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The UK economy has continued to disappoint, inflation is coming down quickly, and the economy is more responsive to rate hikes and rate cuts than Europe or the US,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Therefore, the central bank should be able to cut rates fairly soon, I wouldn&#8217;t be shocked if they cut in the next 2-3 months.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment for the UK economy was released on Tuesday, with the market expecting a reading of 108k. The unemployment rate is expected to hit 4% after last month&#8217;s 3.9%. Rising unemployment can hurt the UK currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Core inflation numbers are due on Wednesday and are expected to come in at 5.2%, a slight rise from last month&#8217;s 5.1%. The annual inflation rate is expected to rise 0.2% to 4.2%. These numbers will be critical for the BoE&#8217;s interest rate assessment. Further data comes on Thursday with Australian employment in the Asian session, where an improvement is expected from last month&#8217;s negative number.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the UK growth figures will provide further big data later that day. The economy is expected to increase slightly from -0.2% to -0.1% over three months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that weakness in the UK data could lead to a high and a correction for GBP/AUD.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">GBPAUD surged Wednesday after the UK inflation figure surprised markets with a reading above 5.1%.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28599" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPAUD – Daily Chart" width="741" height="588" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png 741w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GBPAUD-–-Daily-Chart-300x238.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">GBPAUD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">GBPAUD surged in 2024, moving from around 1.870 to 1.933. This resistance level for the GBPAUD goes back to October, but there is room to move above that level if the rally continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The British pound has surged against the Aussie dollar as the Reserve Bank of Australia held back on interest rate hikes. The UK had higher inflation, and traders expect a premium over the Aussie rate. The focus has since turned to the UK&#8217;s weak economy and expected rate cuts. However, that belief has been rocked by today&#8217;s inflation above 5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Australian economy has also struggled to balance the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">exchange rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The resistance level will be tested tomorrow due to employment figures for the Australian economy being released at 8:30 am HKT. After posting 61.5k new jobs last month, the number is expected to slow to 17.6k this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Australian dollar has been hurt recently by poor steel production from the Chinese economy. A GDP report showing Chinese growth at 5.2% for the year may boost the Aussie dollar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chinese steel production declined for a fifth consecutive month in December, falling 11.4% from November to 67.44 million tons. That marked the lowest monthly output since December 2017, according to NBS data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No way to &#8216;sugarcoat&#8217; it, that&#8217;s just very weak Chinese steel production data for December,&#8221; said analyst Robert Rennie at Westpac Bank.</span></p>
