										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="line-height: 2">Recently, ATFX charitable endeavors have set sail once again. The ATFX Thailand team participated in a volunteer camp project organized by third-year students from the School of Computer Engineering at Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna. The project aimed to provide educational equipment for children&#8217;s development in schools by the year 2023. ATFX extended their heartfelt assistance to students at Ban Sop Wak School in Chiang Mai, Thailand.</p>
<p><span id="more-11869"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2">During this charitable event, ATFX not only made practical contributions but also assisted the school in various tasks such as painting, cleaning, creating room signs, repairing ceilings and tiled areas. Their sincere help was greatly appreciated by the teachers and students. In addition to providing educational equipment to the students of Ban Sop Wak School, the ATFX team also privately addressed students&#8217; queries regarding the use and operation of the educational equipment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">At the end of April 2022, the ATFX volunteer team set off again. This time, ATFX came to the “Que Huong Charity Centre” in Binh Duong Province, Vietnam. Knowing that the centre was built mainly for the homeless, orphans and children, ATFX members brought living materials for the recipients and had in-depth conversations with the centre staff.</p>
<p><span id="more-11289"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">At the site, ATFX members were warmly welcomed by the centre staff. ATFX staff stood in the crowd wearing clothes with the logo printed on them, and the children welcomed the ATFX team with sincere smiles. The Que Huong Charity Centre also expressed its profound gratitude to ATFX for the public welfare activity and awarded a certificate of extraordinary significance to ATFX.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">Considering the actual needs of the recipients, the ATFX team brought them daily necessities and living materials, including noodles, cooking materials, rice and other supplies. ATFX members also bonded with the children by answering questions, singing and dancing, which made everyone quite happy. Everyone involved highly appreciated the day’s activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">The team said that ATFX has always championed “<span style="font-style: italic">Creating shared value</span>” as its mission in its many years of engaging in public welfare activities. The company has always been at the forefront of the financial industry regarding charitable and social responsibility obligations. The charity brand<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/about-us/company-news/fintech-pioneer-in-fx-trading-industry" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ATFX Cares</a><span>&nbsp;</span>was born to spearhead the broker’s CSR activities. The company will continue to increase its investment in public welfare and charity activities in the future. In addition, ATFX plans to take practical actions to participate in more corporate social responsibilities to spread love and care to those who need it the most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">Last year, ATFX, through its corporate and social responsibility arm, <a href="/en/about-us/company-news/fintech-pioneer-in-fx-trading-industry" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ATFX Cares</a>, joined other volunteers during the Panglao Dive Festival to do a coastal cleanup and coral reef restoration with local Filipino financial partners. This year, the ATFX team came to Panglao Island in the Philippines again to participate in the cleanup of the surrounding ocean.</p>
<p><span id="more-11143"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">ATFX teamed up with the Environment and Natural Resources Office of Panglao City (MENRO) this year to jointly sponsor the restoration of 5 coral beds at a coral nursery in the Doljo area. The team also did “reforestation” to reduce the area’s increasing marine pollution. In subsequent public welfare activities, ATFX will regularly conduct activities such as cleaning algae and shells, coastal cleaning, collecting garbage such as fishing lines and plastics, and checking for signs of coral diseases such as discoloration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">It was gratifying to note that the implementation of regular care and the restoration of the four coral beds that ATFX sponsored last year had achieved excellent results. The Doljo area had seen rapid coral growth since last year’s cleanup event. Reef rangers would dive at least 2 to 3 times a week during the following year to check whether the planted corals were growing well. In addition, ATFX Cares will continue monitoring the restoration of coral reefs in this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">Joyce Ann Mayo, Head of ATFX Philippines office, said: “It is ATFX&#8217;s responsibility to contribute to society. We don’t exist in silos. The people we contact every day may be our customers, partners, or employees. We do this because we believe it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the world we live in. No corporation can exist without our beautiful planet.”</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">The broker created a promotion campaign centred around the Chinese New Year celebrations to help farmers export their oranges. ATFX bought oranges from the farmers and delivered them as a Chinese New Year gift to its clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">The promotion ran from 19 January 2022 to 4 February 2022, where the broker bought 500 kilograms of oranges from the northern farmer group piloted at Chiangmai. The oranges are known as &#8220;Sai Nam Phueng&#8221; in Pai province.</p>

The broker is keen to have a significant positive impact in multiple regions.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">ATFX encourages our clients to participate in such events by continuing to trade with the company or by being physically involved in some of the events.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">The point is that trading with ATFX is more than enough since the broker channels a percentage of its profits into programs that help those in need within each country.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75;text-align: justify">ATFX understands that the COVID-19 pandemic has hurt many communities and will continue doing its best to give back to the communities in which it operates.</p>

On January 22, 2022, ATFX corporate social responsibility team, ATFX Cares and SmarTrade, together with local government authorities, distributed relief supplies to Bien Unido, a city in the Bohol Province, to aid the communities still suffering from lack of electricity and lack of purified drinking water in the typhoon’s aftermath.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span id="more-11003"></span></p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75"><span style="font-size: 18px">When ATFX learned that a severe typhoon had hit Bohol and that there was a massive demand for relief supplies, ATFX Cares and SmarTrade immediately took action to quickly buy the daily necessities and deliver them to the disaster area. They distributed 200 food pails containing a blanket, rice, and canned goods, 100 food bags, 250 water jugs and bottled water, and 150 hygiene kits.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75"><span style="font-size: 18px">After completing the disaster relief project in Bohol, the ATFX team proceeded to a housing community for the disabled and the blind in Panglao. It gave out 30 sets of additional supplies to help the community recover from the disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;line-height: 1.75"><span style="font-size: 18px">The ATFX team said that it would continue helping in the reconstruction and development of Bohol and other parts of the Philippines. In the meantime, ATFX’s public welfare and philanthropic activities will never end. We hope to establish <a href="/en/duke-of-edinburgh-cup-sponsorship/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">partnerships</a> with more charitable organizations and groups worldwide, carrying out different projects jointly and taking practical actions to help people in need live a better life.</span></p>
