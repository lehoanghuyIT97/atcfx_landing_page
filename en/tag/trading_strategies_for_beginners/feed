										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In forex trading, opening a position is just the beginning. For traders following a position trading strategy, learning when and how to add positions is key to maximizing opportunities. Besides simply setting a position, a seasoned position trader manages trades dynamically, building into trends or adjusting entries as market conditions evolve.</p>
<p>At ATFX, we believe that understanding positional trading techniques and applying them wisely within a solid risk management plan, is essential to trading successfully.</p>
<h2>1. What Is Position Trading?</h2>
<p>Position trading is a long-term approach where traders hold positions for extended periods, typically ranging from days to weeks or even months. The goal is to capture major price movements by aligning trades with broader economic or fundamental trends.</p>
<p>When asking <em>“what is positional trading,”</em> think of it as the opposite of <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/best-forex-pairs-for-scalpers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scalping</a> or day trading. Instead of reacting to short-term volatility, a position trader takes fewer, more deliberate trades based on a macro view of the market. This approach often relies on fundamental analysis, supported by technical confirmation.</p>
<h2>2. Pros and Cons of Position Trading</h2>
<p>Before applying any position trading strategy, it’s essential to weigh the benefits and trade-offs. Long-term trading can offer stability, but it’s not without challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower trade frequency:</strong> Fewer trades mean lower transaction costs and less emotional pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with macro trends:</strong> A position trader typically rides broader trends backed by strong economic narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Less screen time:</strong> Positional trading does not demand constant monitoring, offering more flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requires patience and discipline:</strong> Trades may take days or weeks to develop.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to macro events:</strong> Holding through weekends or data releases increases risk.</li>
<li><strong>Prolonged drawdowns:</strong> Market reversals or consolidations can test a trader’s conviction and capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these trade-offs helps traders assess if position trading suits their personality, strategy, and risk appetite.</p>
<h2>3. Why Add Positions?</h2>
<p>In many positional trading techniques, adding positions is a tactical way to manage capital, improve average entry price, or build into momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Adding Positions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximize profits:</strong> Leverage a winning trend by adding positions to amplify returns.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalise on favourable price action:</strong> Adding to a position when market signals confirm a good opportunity</li>
<li><strong>Efficient capital deployment:</strong> Gradually scaling in reduces initial risk while maintaining flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, without solid <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk management</a>, adding can lead to overexposure, particularly if the market turns suddenly.</p>
<p>Before placing a trade, use a <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/position-size-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">position size calculator</a> to determine how many units to buy or sell based on your account size, risk tolerance, and stop-loss level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/trader-magazine"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-45553 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-1024x256.jpg" alt="Trader Magazine-High" width="800" height="200" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h2>4. Pyramiding &#8211; Adding to Winning Trades for Position Trading Strategy &amp; Technique</h2>
<p>Pyramiding is a smart way for a position trader to build on strength. This technique involves adding to a position only when it becomes profitable, often after a pullback or breakout confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open an initial position with modest size.</li>
<li>As the price moves in your favour, add smaller positions at key intervals.</li>
<li>Use trailing stops or layered risk to protect profits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why It Works in Position Trading:</strong></p>
<p>It uses unrealized gains to increase exposure without increasing initial risk, making it one of the most effective positional trading techniques for trending markets.</p>
<p><strong>Best used in:</strong> Strong, directional markets where momentum is clear and sustained.</p>
<h2>5. Averaging Down &#8211; Adding to Losing Trades</h2>
<p>A more controversial position trading strategy is averaging down, where a trader adds to a losing position as the market moves against them, aiming to lower the average entry price.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>You buy GBP/USD at 1.2500. Price drops to 1.2450, so you buy again. While each <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/ways-to-trade/cfd-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second Contract trade</a> is separate, most platforms display a combined average entry price, making recovery easier if the market rebounds.</p>
<p><strong>Risk: </strong>If the trend continues against you, losses snowball. This technique requires strict risk control and should only be used in ranging markets or during temporary corrections within broader trends.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Experienced traders with high conviction and defined risk limits.</p>
<h2>6. Martingale Strategy &#8211; Doubling Down Aggressively</h2>
<p>The Martingale system takes averaging down to the extreme, by doubling the position size after each losing trade, aiming to recover with a single win.</p>
<p><strong>Why It’s Risky:</strong></p>
<p>It assumes the market will eventually reverse. But prolonged losing streaks can wipe out an account. While it may appeal to high-risk traders, it’s generally not suitable for most position traders.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Advanced traders maintaining a high margin level and strong risk management, and even then, cautiously.</p>
<h2>7. Grid Trading &#8211; Adding Positions at Regular Intervals</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-grid-trading-how-does-it-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grid trading</a> places buy and sell orders at fixed price intervals above and below the market, regardless of trend direction.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a “grid” of pending orders.</li>
<li>As price fluctuates, positions are triggered and closed based on movement.</li>
<li>Profits are harvested in increments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for Position Traders?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in sideways markets. However, in trending markets, grids can lead to large drawdowns if trades are not managed or hedged.</p>
<p><strong>Best used in:</strong> Range-bound or consolidating markets, often with Electronic Advisor (EA) support.</p>
<h2>8. Scaling In Before Confirmation &#8211; Aggressive Entry Strategy</h2>
<p>Some advanced traders choose to scale in before confirmation, entering with a small position based on early price action signals.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use It: </strong>You gain early exposure and can capitalise if the trend unfolds. If you&#8217;re wrong, the loss is small due to low initial size.</p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong> Higher chance of being stopped out in whipsaws or false breakouts.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Skilled traders who are confident reading market structure and know when to exit fast.</p>
<h5><strong>Final Thoughts from ATFX for Position Trading</strong></h5>
<p>Adding positions can strengthen a position trading strategy too close together when guided by clarity, discipline, and market awareness. Whether you&#8217;re building into trends with pyramiding or managing ranges with grid setups, success depends on choosing the right technique and managing risk effectively.</p>
<p>ATFX equip position traders with powerful tools, expert insights, and advanced platform features to help you trade smarter.</p>
<p><strong>Trade with precision. Stay in control. And in position trading, one good entry can be the start of something big.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/copy-trading">Copy Trading</a> is a game-changer in the trading world, allowing less experienced individuals, or “followers” to automatically copy the trades of successful professionals, making financial markets more accessible. Professional traders, or &#8220;providers,&#8221; can share strategies and earn additional income. This system connects providers with followers, eliminating the need for complex strategies or constant market monitoring, while enabling followers to trade with confidence and ease.</p>
<h2>How CopyTrade Works?</h2>
<h3>Step-by-Step Process for Followers:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Selecting a Provider</strong></p>
<p>Followers choose a provider whose strategies match their goals and risk tolerance. <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/trading-platforms/atfx-copytrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATFX CopyTrade</a> platforms offer performance statistics, including trading history, success rate, and market focus, to help followers make informed decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Allocating Funds</strong></p>
<p>Once a provider is selected, followers allocate funds to copy the provider’s trades. The amount invested can vary depending on the follower’s budget and desired exposure to the provider&#8217;s strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Replication in Real-Time</strong></p>
<p>After funds are allocated, trades made by the provider are automatically copied in real time. This allows the follower to mirror the provider’s trades, from entry to exit, proportionally based on the funds allocated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 4 </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flexibility in Settings</strong></p>
<p>Followers can adjust certain settings, such as the percentage of their portfolio to copy, stop-loss limits, or even choose to stop copying a provider at any time. This flexibility ensures followers can manage risk according to their preferences.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-46240 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-CopyTrade-Works-For-Followers-and-Providers-1024x526.webp" alt="How CopyTrade Works For Followers and Providers" width="800" height="411" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-CopyTrade-Works-For-Followers-and-Providers-1024x526.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-CopyTrade-Works-For-Followers-and-Providers-300x154.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-CopyTrade-Works-For-Followers-and-Providers-768x395.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-CopyTrade-Works-For-Followers-and-Providers.webp 1344w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Step-by-Step Process for Providers:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1 </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Setting Up an Account</strong></p>
<p>To become a provider, traders must set up an account with a platform that supports CopyTrade. This typically involves providing a track record of successful trades and demonstrating experience and reliability.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2 </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements for Providers</strong></p>
<p>Providers often need to meet specific criteria, such as a minimum trading history and performance benchmarks, to ensure they are qualified to offer their strategies to followers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3 </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Replication for Followers</strong></p>
<p>Once set up, a provider’s trades are automatically replicated by followers who have chosen to copy them. Providers’ earnings will depend on the success of their trades and the number of followers who choose to copy them.</p>

<h2>Benefits for Followers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy Access to Expert Strategies: </strong>By using CopyTrade, followers gain access to the strategies of experienced traders. This eliminates the need for deep market knowledge or years of experience, allowing newcomers to benefit from the success of seasoned traders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience: </strong>For many, the biggest barrier to trading is the time commitment. CopyTrade allows followers to participate in the market without having to constantly monitor it. Traders can set up their copy preferences and let the system handle the rest.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Management: </strong>Followers can manage their risk by selecting providers who fit their desired risk profiles. Additionally, diversifying across multiple providers can help spread risk and increase the chances of consistent returns.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Benefit: </strong>CopyTrade also offers an educational benefit. Followers have the opportunity to observe the trading decisions of top traders, learning from their strategies and gaining insights into successful market approaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits for Providers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional Income: </strong>For successful traders, CopyTrade presents an additional income stream. Providers earn commissions or a percentage of the profits generated by followers who copy their trades.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reputation Building: </strong>Providers who consistently perform well can build a strong reputation and attract more followers. This can increase their visibility within the trading community and solidify their credibility as a successful trader.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation to Improve: </strong>Knowing that their trades are being copied, providers may be more motivated to refine their strategies and manage risk more effectively, knowing that their reputation and income depend on consistent success.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Considerations of Potential Risks</h2>
<h2><strong>Risks for Followers</strong></h2>
<p>While CopyTrade offers convenience, it is not without risks. The success of a provider&#8217;s strategy can fluctuate with market conditions, and followers are exposed to the same risks as the provider. Inconsistent performance, market volatility, and provider fees can all impact returns.</p>
<h2>Risks for Providers</h2>
<p>Providers may also face pressures. They are responsible for maintaining a high level of performance to retain and grow their following. Poor performance could lead to a loss of followers, damaging their reputation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>CopyTrade is a powerful tool that allows both followers and providers to benefit from a collaborative approach to trading. For followers, it opens the door to professional strategies and market participation without requiring expertise. For providers, it offers an opportunity to monetize their skills and build a following. However, it’s important for both parties to manage their expectations and risk levels carefully, ensuring that CopyTrade remains a beneficial and rewarding experience for everyone involved.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-copy-trading">What is Copy Trading and Why Should Traders Consider It?</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading entered the retail FX market in 2006 but did so in a form considered rudimentary by today&#8217;s standards. Since then, copy trading has evolved from the manual system of copying trade signals. We are now at a stage where a copy trade engine automatically replicates the trades from the Provider&#8217;s account to that of the subscribed traders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A senior executive in trading education firm OSCE once said in an interview that it takes about two years for a new trader to acquire the experience to become successful. The question is: how many traders have two years to do this?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most new entrants into the forex market do not have two years to commit to learning. Some may be too busy with their primary jobs and daily schedules. For these, copy trading holds the maximum benefit, as it shortens the learning curve and removes the need for trade analysis, which takes a lot of time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The words &#8220;copy trading&#8221; simply mean copying the trades of another. Trades have several elements.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">There is the analysis part, where the trader looks at several parameters and determines the direction of the trade.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The trade order component is where the trader sets one of several potential pending or market-price-based orders that mirror the trader&#8217;s thinking of where the asset is headed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">There are the entry and exit orders (manual closure, protection stop/stop loss, and take profit orders).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Every order includes the name of the asset being traded, the order size, the type of order, and conditionals (good till canceled, good till entry, etc.).</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a copy trading platform, there are two sets of traders:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the Provider of the trades and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the Follower who copies the trades.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">When a Follower subscribes to follow the Provider&#8217;s trades, the trades are automatically replicated on the Follower&#8217;s account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Apart from copying the exact entry and exit points, the copy trade engine automatically works out the trade size to be copied based on the defined risk settings on the Follower&#8217;s account. Providers and Followers do not have similar account sizes, so it is impossible to copy the same trade volume used by the Provider on the Follower&#8217;s account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The percentage of capital held by the Follower versus that of the Provider determines the trade size used in the copied signals in the same ratio.</p>

<p dir="ltr">To get started with copy trading, it is essential to follow laid-down procedures to ensure you get the best start.</p>
<ol class="no-markers">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Choose a broker for copy trading</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Choosing a broker for copy trading differs slightly from just choosing one for regular forex trading. This is because there are several features that such a broker must have in place to facilitate a seamless and beneficial experience for both Providers and Followers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are some steps to consider when choosing a broker for copy trading.</p>
<p>The broker needs to be regulated. Regulation is all about customer protection, and both Followers and Providers need to be able to work knowing that their funds are safe and secure.</p>
<p>Copy trade platforms typically display leaderboards where top traders can display their trading stats. However, a broker with a copy trading engine must go further to incorporate specific analytics highlighting the critical aspects of the Provider&#8217;s trading activity. This also helps the potential Follower to make informed selections of whose trades to copy.</p>
<p>A suitable broker for copy trading should have various payment channels to help their clients access the service, irrespective of country of origin or domicile.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Select a strategy and trader to follow</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">When choosing a Provider&#8217;s trades to follow, it is essential to understand some elements of that Provider&#8217;s trading metrics to see if that strategy suits you.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How aggressive or conservative is the trader&#8217;s strategy?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How long has the Provider been trading?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is the profitability of the Provider like?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How long do the Provider&#8217;s trades last? (this indicates whether the Provider is a scalper, swing or position trader).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is the profitability chart like? You want to see a chart that shows a gradual but steady climb and not a zig-zag chart that paints a picture of inconsistency and heavy drawdowns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Your selection of a Provider will also have to consider your situation, risk appetite, the amount of capital at your disposal, and your profit goals. Some traders want aggressive trading styles that can produce profits quickly, while others may be more conservative and want smaller returns based on a less aggressive trading style. No size fits all, and the job of this article is not to make any recommendations. Choose a Provider that matches your goals and risk appetite.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">How to view and analyze trader performance</h3>
<ol class="no-markers" start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Set up copy trading</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Setting up your copy trading account on ATFX is a simple process. ATFX has designed the onboarding process so that once you have a regular trading account with ATFX, you can access the ATFX CopyTrade service with a few clicks of your mouse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once you have signed up and want to subscribe to a Provider, click on New Subscriptions. In the open dialogue box, scroll down and select the Provider to follow under the Provider tab. Pick from any of the Providers listed, then click on Create. Usually, the stats of the Provider and the subscription fee is displayed. Once you click the &#8220;Create&#8221; button, the system will allow you to follow that Provider.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You may also click on Rankings, then click on your preferred Provider’s profile. Once the profile opens, click “Invest” on the top right of the screen.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Monitor and adjust your copy trading activity</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The forex market is very dynamic, meaning that you have to review the performance of your Provider&#8217;s strategies and tweak your selections continually to ensure they keep up with the changes in the forex market. This is why you cannot afford not to monitor your copy trading activity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, some other Providers&#8217; strategies may outperform the one(s) whose trades you are currently copying. Trader performance could also drop off with time. All these points indicate one thing: you must be ready to change those whose trades you follow periodically.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How can you adjust your copy trading portfolio when changing your Provider?</p>
<ol class="no-markers">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Constantly check the leaderboard to see which traders are topping, how their strategies work, and if their trading styles match your goals and risk appetite.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Check your profit performance over time. Is there a drop in profitability, or are you now incurring many losses? If this is the case, it may be time to change your Provider.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Do you notice that there are times when the trades you are copying do not perform well? Is there any other Provider that is doing well in those times? You may have to make some changes in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Try to use a virtual private server with your MT4 or MT5 client to reduce the latency of your trade executions. Using a VPS helps when there is a lot of volatility and price swings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">Tips for adjusting your strategy or trader if needed</h3>
<p dir="ltr">As you participate in the copy trade process, you will find out that you will constantly need to adjust your portfolio by changing the Providers you copy. At other times, you may need to tweak some parameters with the same Provider, such as adjusting the lot size of the trades copied to your account to match acceptable risk management standards. What you want to do concerning the tweaks you want to make will determine how you go about it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One way to look out for new Providers who may have started outperforming the ones you have chosen is to study the performance charts. In the snapshot above, you can see at least two where the charts plateaued after a period of gains. There is one which started off losing but picked up and has been on the ascendance (chart to the right). There is also another which displays a zig-zag performance that indicates some inconsistency. These are pointers to the performance of the Providers in question.</p>

<h2 id="advantages-of-copy-trading">Advantages of Copy Trading with ATFX</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading today would not be thriving if there was no demand for it, and if it was not a system that works for many people. There are definitely advantages to copy trading, and more so if you do it on the ATFX CopyTrade platform.</p>
<ol class="no-markers">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Access to Expertise</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The immediate advantage that users of ATFX CopyTrade&#8217;s platform will get is that they can access the expertise of more experienced traders, thereby shortening their learning curve and hitting the ground running.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It takes many months and up to 2-3 years to start getting good at trading, and only if the trader is dedicated to learning, researching, backtesting, and mentorship. You will skip many initial obstacles when you copy the trades of the experienced and profitable Providers on the ATFX CopyTrade platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46326 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Typical-returns-chart-for-a-Provider-on-ATFX-CopyTrade.jpg" alt="Typical returns chart for a Provider on ATFX CopyTrade" width="874" height="569" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Typical-returns-chart-for-a-Provider-on-ATFX-CopyTrade.jpg 874w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Typical-returns-chart-for-a-Provider-on-ATFX-CopyTrade-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Typical-returns-chart-for-a-Provider-on-ATFX-CopyTrade-768x500.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><b>Typical returns chart for a Provider on ATFX CopyTrade</b></p>
<p dir="ltr">You may have heard that no coach changes a winning team. In forex trading, you do not need to reinvent the wheel if you can copy the same trades of those who have already invented their wheels and are moving on profitably. Furthermore, you can also access better risk management techniques than you would ordinarily be able to pull off on your own.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Practice makes perfect. After every trade, there is always the opportunity to go back and reverse engineer the trades to understand what thought processes went into the analyses and execution of each position. In that manner, you start improving your trading skills without knowing it.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Time-Saving</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading with ATFX CopyTrade will save you a lot of precious time. Copytrading will help you eliminate all the time spent analyzing charts, chasing pips all over the market, and scanning through several news sources. The only real work you do is to use the selection metrics to pick the right Provider. Everything else is automated once connected to the Provider&#8217;s signals using the copy trade engine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a significant advantage to those with hectic schedules at work, school, or other activities. How possible would it be to be in a lecture hall and analyze a chart for a potential opportunity? How can you monitor trades in the bank, shopping mall, office space, or tending to a baby as a domestic helper? These are impossible situations where trading profitably is just not possible. But once you subscribe to a profitable Provider on the ATFX CopyTrade platform, your trades are executed and closed without your input, a great time-saving process.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Diversification</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading is not only for newbies. Even traders with some level of experience and success can create a copy trading account as a means of portfolio diversification. You can trade your main account on ATFX actively and still follow another Provider passively using a copy trade account. Even successful traders who want to profit from having other traders copy their trades can use the copy trade platform for a second income stream. Such diversification of income is never a minus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For those who copy the trades of others on ATFX CopyTrade, you should also know that nothing stops you from copying the trades of multiple Providers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No two Providers trade the same asset. You can pick one Provider who trades gold, another who trades the EUR/USD, another who trades the Brent crude contract, and yet another who is at home with the US stock indices to get a well-rounded, well-diversified portfolio that gives you multi-asset exposure. Since some markets will consistently outperform others at various times, you can use the gains of one Provider to make up for any losses incurred from another Provider.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Lower Costs</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading can be a cost-effective way to participate in the markets. You get the same level of service as if you had to use a Forex robot. Forex robots can be expensive, and many do not allow one to look into any form of history that can be used to gauge profitability. The best you will ever have is backtests, which are usually a poor gauge of future profitability. Furthermore, you are less likely to get your money back once you have purchased a Forex robot. If the robot becomes a junk product, you are out of luck!</p>
<p dir="ltr">But with a copy trade service, you avoid the costs of purchasing indicators and robots, and the struggle of conducting backtests on every asset, a time-consuming process. Subscription fees for the ATFX CopyTrade service are pocket friendly, and some traders can cover the costs with a single day of successful copy trades.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Easy to Get Started</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">It is easy to start with copy trading as it requires no previous experience. Everything has been simplified on the ATFX CopyTrade platform. A few clicks of the mouse button on your computer are all you need to get connected. It all starts with opening your trading account with ATFX. This is a 3-step process that is made very easy. Once you have obtained your login details, you can sign up for the ATFX CopyTrade account in one step.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After gaining login access, it is time to choose the Provider you wish to follow. There is a Leaderboard that features all Providers and their performance stats. You can click against each Provider&#8217;s profile and perform a deeper analysis of aspects of their trading, such as risk management, profitability over a selected period, or the number of pips gained in a day, a week, a month, or a quarter.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="risks-and-limitations">Risks and Limitations of Copy Trading</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading in itself does not eliminate the various risks that exist in the market. It is important that those using this service as a passive investment understand the risks that copy trading can pose to their accounts.</p>
<ol class="no-markers">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Lack of Control</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the risks of copy trading to Followers is that they do not have complete control of their trades once they have signed up for the service. They are at the absolute mercy of the Followers whose trades they are copying. If a Follower suddenly turns unprofitable and loses ten trades in a row, the same results are replicated on the Follower&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>All elements of the Provider&#8217;s trades are copied: risk exposure size, entry and exit prices. If a Provider is risking more than the recommended 5% of his account size in trades, the same measure of risk is applied to the Follower&#8217;s account. If the Provider uses risk-reward ratios that do not conform to acceptable risk management standards, the same ratios are applied to the Follower&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>Since the Follower cannot set their stop loss or take profit levels, they are entirely vulnerable to any poor judgments and trading decisions of the Provider. The only way to prevent this is to unsubscribe from the Provider&#8217;s trades completely. Any subscriptions are not usually refunded, so you must choose your trade Providers carefully.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Over-Reliance on Signal Providers</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading makes the Follower dependent on the Provider. The ATFX CopyTrade platform only presents the opportunity. It is your job as a trader to select the Provider to follow. If you choose wrongly, everything else will follow suit. If you cannot use the trading metrics and statistics of the Providers at your disposal to make an informed choice of whose trades to copy to avoid finding yourself in hot waters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This over-reliance on signal/trade providers has its merits and demerits. Suppose you depend 100% on the trades provided by the trader you follow, and you cannot detect changes in strategy or market conditions that may pose a risk to profitable outcomes. In that case, you will have problems along the way. The lesson here is not to rely too much on signal providers. It pays to have some knowledge so you know when to disable the copied trades from a faltering Provider or when to choose another Provider entirely.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Risk of Fraud and Scams</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Any industry or sector with high financial turnover will surely attract the bad guys. Forex is not immune to scams, so do not expect any less from the copy-trading industry. You must know how to protect yourself from the common scams within the copy-trading industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What kind of scams can occur in copy trading?</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Misrepresentation of trade results by fraudulent signal providers. Some signals providers have found ways of deleting a bad run of results so it does not show up in their trade history.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Manipulation of market inefficiencies.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Posting unusually high trade returns without highlighting the serious risk involved is a practice that paints a one-sided picture of what can happen in the market if unduly high risk is used. Some Providers use a lucky run of results as the source of their trade history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Traders should also be wary of Providers with unusually high returns without other metrics backing up these returns. You may end up subscribing to the services of a Provider who has thrown risk management to the dogs, and you could lose your money very quickly.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Market Risk</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">What are market risks? Market risks are events in the forex market that can lead to sudden and unexpected capital loss. These risk events include news trades, slippage, and other events beyond human control, such as natural disasters, outbreaks of war, a global pandemic, or terrorist attacks with global ramifications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several examples of such risk events have occurred in the last twenty years. Copy trading does not protect the trader from or eliminate market risks.</p>
<ol class="no-markers">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">9/11 terrorist attacks on several targets in the US on 11 September 2001 caused a severe market upheaval that struck several financial markets.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The 15 January 2015 de-pegging of the Swiss Franc from the Euro by the Swiss National Bank.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2011 caused a massive safe-haven demand and strengthening of the Japanese Yen, necessitating intervention by the Bank of Japan.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The unexpected premarket interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve on 22 January 2008.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The sudden outbreak of the Libyan civil war in 2011</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. This also led to several unscheduled and unexpected interest rate cuts by global central banks, creating a massive shock in the currency markets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">If you have any active trades placed on your account via a copy trading portal, you will be exposed and could suffer devastating losses. These market risk events are usually unexpected and cause severe market shocks. They typically cause slippage, which overwhelms the ability of brokers or counterparties to honor pre-set stop loss settings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It will help if you remember that such events can occur and you can protect yourself as much as you can for such times.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Lack of Customization</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Copy trading has sometimes been likened to a master-slave relationship, though not in the strict sense. Anything the Provider does regarding trading reflects on the Follower&#8217;s account without the latter&#8217;s input. The Follower has no say in the trade process or trade outcome, which means that the Follower cannot perform any form of customization.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46232 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-tradestats.jpg" alt="ATCopy-tradestats" width="907" height="607" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-tradestats.jpg 907w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-tradestats-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-tradestats-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Trade Statistics for a Provider</strong></p>
<p>It is impossible to adjust the Provider&#8217;s trading style to match the risk preferences of the Follower. You cannot choose what assets the Provider trades or change the Provider&#8217;s trading style to match your preferences. So you are forced to accept every element of the Provider&#8217;s trading behaviour.</p>
<p>If a Provider gets too emotional on a particular trading day and starts to make trading errors, the best the Follower can do is to unfollow that Provider completely. There is no chance of a refund in such circumstances. This is why you must consider your individual needs and only select a Provider who can match your preferences with their risk management, trading style, and overall performance.</p>

<h2 id="popular-terms">Popular Copy Trading Terms</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">Social trading</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Social trading is a form of trade practice where traders come together in communities to trade the market, as opposed to individual traders working alone. Copy trading is an advanced form of social trading where there are leaders (Providers) whose trades are copied by the rest of the subscribed community.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Mirror trading</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Mirror trading is a system in which investors or traders in the forex market copy the trades of other more experienced and relatively more successful traders. Copy trading is a form of mirror trading which automates the process.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Copy trading platforms</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading platforms are automated trade engines that take the trades of experienced traders and automatically place these same trades on the accounts of less experienced traders who are subscribed to the service.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Copy trader/follower</h3>
<p dir="ltr">A copy trader/follower is a trader who registers on the ATFX CopyTrade platform to have the trades of any experienced traders they are subscribed to automatically replicated on their trading accounts. To be a Follower, you need to register an account with ATFX, then sign up for the copy trade service and subscribe to follow the trades of another experienced trader.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Provider</h3>
<p dir="ltr">These experienced traders register on the ATFX CopyTrade platform to have their trades subscribed to and copied by other less experienced traders. To be a Provider, you must have generated a decent amount of trading history, allowing potential Followers to assess your trade metrics as they decide on whose trades to copy.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Pips</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Also known as Percentage Interest Point, the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-pip-in-forex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pip</a> is the smallest unit of price change in a currency pair and is equivalent to 0.0001 points (i.e. 1/10,000th of a point). Therefore, if a currency pair has moved from 1.1103 to 1.1178, the price change is 0.0075 points or 75 pips.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Risk management</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Risk management refers to the set of rules and principles that guide the setting of trade positions in the Forex or Second Contract market, enabling a trader’s account to survive any adverse price movements in the market.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Stop loss</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Also known as a protection stop, and the stop loss is an order to the broker to automatically close the trade if the price action has moved against the trader’s position by a set number of pips. The SL is used to prevent the trader from suffering devastating losses.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Take profit</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Take Profit (TP) is an instruction to the broker to close the trade automatically if the price action has moved in the direction of the trader’s position by a set number of pips. The TP is used to lock in any unrealized profits in a trade.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Slippage</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/the-reason-and-influence-of-slippage">Slippage</a> is a market risk event in which there is a difference between the price set by the trader for the execution of an order and the actual price at which that order is executed.Slippage occurs during times of market volatility that is so extreme that it becomes impossible to find matching counterparty orders to fulfil a trader’s orders.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Drawdown</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The drawdown in forex refers to the percentage by which a trade, the equity or the margin has dropped from its peak before it recovers this peak. Drawdowns in copy trading usually result from the Provider practising poor risk management, rendering improper entries or trading in extremely volatile market conditions.</p>

<h2 id="copy-trade-with-atfx">Copy Trade With ATFX: Overview and Key Features</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">Introduction</h3>
<p dir="ltr">ATFX is a forex and Second Contract broker which also has as one of its products, a copy trading service. Typically, copy trading platforms are offered to the investing public by non-brokerage companies. By offering an in-house copy trading platform, ATFX has made it possible to directly incorporate all processes that are involved in the copy trade process. Trade results of Providers are taken directly from their trading history on the ATFX platform, providing the potential Followers with inviolable analytics and data to facilitate an informed selection of the experienced traders they choose to follow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ATFX CopyTrade engine also allows profitable traders to add a second stream of income to their regular trading activity by allowing potential Followers to copy their trades for a nominal fee.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Signal Providers</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There are three parties to the copy trading service: the Provider, the copy trade broker (ATFX) and the Follower (a passive investor who copies the trades). Anyone can be a Signal Provider, provided you can demonstrate that you have a long history of profitable trading and solid risk management.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46230 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-assets.jpg" alt="ATCopy-assets" width="885" height="484" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-assets.jpg 885w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-assets-300x164.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-assets-768x420.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Profile of Provider showing assets traded and number of trades per asset</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As a Provider, ATFX CopyTrade will provide you with the platform to showcase your skills and trading history to the world. You will be competing with others for the subscription of Followers, so it is essential as a Provider to trade in such a way that potential Followers will have the confidence to follow your trades and replicate your profitable results. There is a Leaderboard that displays various metrics by which selections are made.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a Follower, you will be provided with a list of several potential Providers. You can make your informed choice based on several trading parameters such as profitability, previous performance, drawdown %, trading style, and risk appetite. The benefit of choosing a good Provider becomes imminent as their profits become your profits as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Learn more about <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-copytrade-works">how copytrade works for followers and providers</a>, the process, and its advantages and disadvantages.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Customizable Settings</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading platforms, like ATFX, allow all Followers to customise certain settings to attain optimal risk management on their accounts. This is because account sizes differ. A trader with a $1,000 account who follows a Provider with a $100,000 account cannot take the same lot sizes as the Provider, as this would not be a good risk management practice. This is why copy trading platforms allow Followers to adjust risk settings, take profit/stop loss settings and other metrics that are defined uniquely to each platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at the ATFX CopyTrade interface, we can see a few metrics that Followers can adjust. For instance, how is the trade size adjusted?</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a tool known as the Volume Scaling tool. This is used to set the ratio of the copied trade&#8217;s volume to that of the Provider. Three settings are recognized: Autoscale, Multiply and Fixed. A volume multiplier allows you to specify the fraction of the Follower&#8217;s trade size in relation to that of the Provider. If a Follower wants his lot size to be a tenth of the Provider&#8217;s lot size, the volume scaling is set to Multiply, and the Volume Multiplier is set to 0.1.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46231 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Multiplier-volume.jpg" alt="Multiplier-volume" width="519" height="451" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Multiplier-volume.jpg 519w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Multiplier-volume-300x261.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Real-time Performance Monitoring</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Once you have started following a Provider, your profit performance based on the Provider&#8217;s trades is visible. You can click against the Follower&#8217;s name to see their recent trading stats. Copy trading platforms like ATFX provide real-time performance updates of all Providers so that Followers can reassess their data to see if the performances are holding up to market scrutiny.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46232 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-tradestats.jpg" alt="ATCopy-tradestats" width="907" height="607" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-tradestats.jpg 907w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-tradestats-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ATCopy-tradestats-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Suppose a Provider is not performing according to the Follower&#8217;s expectations. In that case, the Follower has a choice to either Pause the copying of that Provider&#8217;s trades or to unsubscribe from the Provider completely. These two actions can be done from the same place using the click of a mouse button.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Auto-copy Trading</h3>
<p dir="ltr">How do copy trading platforms like ATFX deliver auto-copy trading functionality? A copy trading engine acts as the intermediary between the Provider and the Followers who have subscribed to receive the Provider&#8217;s trades. The copy trading engine is programmed to ensure the Provider&#8217;s trades are replicated in real-time on their Follower&#8217;s accounts using the defined parameters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The automated nature of the process ensures that traders do not have to do anything manually as far as the trades are concerned. Once a profitable Provider is chosen, the trader must check their results periodically and see how their portfolio is doing. As highlighted earlier, Followers are free to choose any number of Providers they desire to give their portfolio the diversification that ensures a lower-risk profile and good exposure to various markets.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Risk management tools</h3>
<p dir="ltr">What are the market risks that Followers can encounter during copy trading?</p>
<ol class="no-markers">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">News trading risks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Risky behaviour from Providers they follow.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The drop-off in performance of a previously profitable Provider.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Improper Volume Scaling settings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The Volume Scaling tool is used to ensure that the trades from Providers are only replicated on the Follower’s account in the same measure of exposure relative to the Follower’s account sizes. You do not want to be trading 2.0 lots on a $1000 account as a Follower if the Provider has a $100,000 account and is also trading 2.0 lots. Since the Follower’s account size is 1/100th of the Provider’s account, the lot size must also be dropped by the same measure to reflect proper risk management. This tool is used to achieve this and is accessible on the Follower’s dashboard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Correction tool is used to define a maximum open volume for each position. This can only be applied to new positions and not to positions that are active. In other words, this tool is used to set a limit on the lot size that can be used to open a position.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46233 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Max-open-volume.jpg" alt="" width="899" height="481" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Max-open-volume.jpg 899w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Max-open-volume-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Max-open-volume-768x411.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Risk Management tool is used to define certain acceptable risk standards that the Follower wants to comply with. These standards centre around:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Parameters (Total loss, Total profit and Floating loss),</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Threshold (the limit for each of the chosen parameters in monetary terms),</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Subscription action (choosing to suspend or unsubscribe from a Provider if there is a breach of the Parameters and the threshold values) and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Trading action (close all trades, keep all or close only unprofitable positions).</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">How does ATFX ensure the safety and security of my funds when copy trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">No Provider will ever have access to your funds. ATFX is a regulated brokerage, licensed in various jurisdictions with account segregation for customers’ funds. These all add a measure of protection to ensure your funds are always safe.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">How much money do I need to start copy trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">You can start copy trading on ATFX for as little as $100. Generally speaking, you should ensure your account is adequately funded to match the trading style of the Provider you follow. For instance, if the Provider’s trades typically incur a 20% drawdown, you should take this into account when funding your account.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">What markets are most suited to copy trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading can be done on any <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial market</a>. However, the most popular market for copy trading is the forex market.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I choose which traders to copy?</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very essence of copy trading is to provide you with the flexibility to choose which traders you want to copy. You are free to copy more than one Provider, and you can choose to change Providers anytime you want.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I still trade on my own while copy-trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Your regular ATFX trading account is different from your ATFX CopyTrade account, so you can trade on your regular account even while copy trading.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Is copy trading available for all financial instruments?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading is available for all financial instruments as long as you can find Providers who are also trading these instruments. When you copy more than one Provider, you can broaden the base of the financial instruments covered by your copy trading activity if those Providers are trading different markets.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I set my own risk management parameters while copy trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">ATFX has a number of risk management tools to enable you to apply your own risk management even while copying trades from a Provider. Some of these tools have been mentioned in the article.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I customise my copy trading strategy to suit my own risk preferences?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">You cannot customise a copy trading strategy to suit your own preferences as all strategies that translate into copied trades belong to the Provider. The best you can do is choose a Provider whose risk management techniques align with your preferences.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">What happens if a trader I am copying incurs losses?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">While you cannot reverse any losses incurred via copy trading, you can unsubscribe from a Provider who has hit a bad run of form.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I stop copying a trader at any time?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">You can stop copying a trader at any time. There are two ways to do this. You can either click the Actions button on your dashboard and click on Unsubscribe in the drop-down menu, or you can use the Risk Management tool to set the parameters that must be breached for automatic cancellation of the subscription to kick in (Risk Management -&lt; Subscription action -&gt; Suspend/Unsubscribe)</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">What kind of returns can I expect from copy trading with ATFX?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Returns on forex trading are not guaranteed. Past results are also not indicative of future outcomes. Whatever returns you make depends on the profitability of any Providers you follow on the ATFX CopyTrade platform.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">How do I withdraw my profits from copy trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">You can withdraw any profits you have made (minus subscription fees) via the payment channels listed on the ATFX website.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Do I need any special knowledge or skills to copy trade?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading allows those without special skills or knowledge to benefit from the forex market. Therefore, you do not need any special knowledge or skills to copy trade if you intend to copy the trades of other experienced traders. You will be using the skills and knowledge of others to try to profit from the market.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I copy trade on my mobile device?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The ATFX CopyTrade portal is compatible with all smartphones. Therefore, you can copy trade on your mobile devices.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I copy trade with a demo account before using real money?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">As it is, you can only copy trade with real money. If you want to try out the process before committing more capital, you can use a small amount in a live account.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Is copy trading legal?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading is legal.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">What is the difference between copy trading and social trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Copy trading involves the automated copying of trades from other experienced traders without any manual input. Social trading is more like a community-based trading system where experienced traders provide signals, which followers have to implement manually on their accounts if they so desire.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I copy trade with multiple traders at the same time?</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can copy trade from multiple traders at the same time. However, you must factor in potential situations where your account has to handle several active trades from different traders. You must ensure your account is well-funded to handle such situations.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Will I be charged any additional fees for using copy trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">You will have to pay a subscription fee to copy the Providers&#8217; trades. Each Provider you follow will attract an extra fee.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I contact the traders I am copying for advice or guidance?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The copy trading portal works via automation, and there is no form of contact between Providers and Followers. Therefore, you will be unable to contact any Providers for advice or guidance. Some Providers have thousands of Followers, and it is not feasible for them to provide such guidance to every single Follower.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">What is the minimum trade size when copy trading?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">You can decide the minimum trade size that will be implemented on your account. In addition, some assets come with a minimum trade size. Generally speaking, 1 micro-lot (0.01 lots) is the minimum trade size you can apply to your account when trading currencies.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Can I follow providers from other countries?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The pool of Providers is formed from experienced traders who come from all over the world. The selection of Providers is not made on a country-specific basis so that you can follow Providers from other countries on the ATFX CopyTrade platform.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-derivative" dir="ltr">What is a Derivative?</h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">A derivative is a financial contract in which the underlying asset decides the value. This asset can be anything that changes in value, such as <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stocks </a>, bonds, <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commodities </a>, <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currencies</a>, interest rates, or <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indices</a>. Derivatives are frequently used to manage or reduce financial risk, speculate on future asset price changes, and increase leverage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both institutional and individual investors regularly use derivatives. For example, corporations may use futures to hedge against volatility in raw material costs. Consider an airline that relies significantly on jet fuel; rising fuel prices may diminish its income. To avoid this risk, the airline might sign a fuel derivative contract that guarantees a specific fuel price, allowing it to maintain steady operational costs.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="types-of-derivatives" dir="ltr">Types of Derivatives</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The derivatives market offers a range of contract types, each with distinct features tailored for various uses. Here is a complete analysis of the main categories of derivatives:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Futures: Futures are standardised contracts for buying or selling an asset at a specific price on a future date. These contracts are tightly regulated and traded on markets like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). A wheat farmer, for example, may use a futures contract to lock in a favourable selling price for the upcoming harvest to protect against future price declines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Options: Options provide the holder the right (but not the duty) to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a defined price before the option expires. They can be used for both loss prevention and speculative purposes. If investors predict a stock&#8217;s price will rise, they can purchase a call option to benefit without buying the shares.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Swaps: Swaps are agreements that enable the exchange of financial assets or liabilities. The most common type is an interest rate swap, which involves parties exchanging fixed interest payments for variable ones. For example, a firm with a variable-rate loan may enter into a swap agreement to pay fixed interest rates, reducing its exposure to the risks of rising interest rates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Forwards: Forward contracts, like futures, are agreements to purchase or sell an item at a fixed price at a later date. However, they are more flexible and are traded over-the-counter (OTC). The flexibility to customize these contracts allows the parties involved to adjust the terms. However, this also increases counterparty risk because they are not traded on standard exchanges.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Contracts for Difference (Second Contract)</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Second Contract are derivative products that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of assets such as forex, stocks, commodities (Oil, Gold), or indices..etc without owning the underlying asset. Traders can profit from both rising and falling markets by taking long (buy) or short (sell) positions.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-derivatives-trading" dir="ltr">What is Derivatives Trading?</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives trading is the purchase and sale of derivatives contracts to hedge risks or benefit from projected price changes in underlying assets. Unlike direct investments in assets like stocks and bonds, derivatives allow traders to profit from price fluctuations without owning the underlying asset.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, a derivatives trader betting on <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crude oil prices </a>may buy oil futures if prices are expected to climb. If oil prices rise, the trader can profitably sell futures contracts. Businesses use futures to control their expenses or profits, hedging against market fluctuations that could hurt their earnings.</p>

<h2 id="how-derivatives-trading-works" dir="ltr">How Derivatives Trading Works</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The workings of derivatives trading can be complex since they differ based on the derivative and the trader&#8217;s goals. Below is a broad outline of how derivatives trading functions:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Contract Creation: The first step is to create or acquire a derivative contract. Exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures and options, contain standard contract terms accessible to everyone with a trading account. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as swaps and forwards, are traded privately, each with unique terms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leverage and Margin: Traders typically trade derivatives on margin, meaning they must put down a portion of the total contract value to begin the transaction. This leverage allows for huge exposure with a small initial investment, increasing the chances of more significant losses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-45550 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin-1024x529.webp" alt="leverage-and-margin" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Fluctuating Value: The value of a derivative contract fluctuates in response to the underlying asset&#8217;s price. For example, the value of a stock option contract fluctuates as the underlying stock price changes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Settlement: Many derivatives, particularly futures contracts, can be settled (closed out) before their expiration. Specific contracts may require physical delivery of the underlying item at expiration, whilst others need a cash settlement based on the current market price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ability to amplify returns and their adaptability gives derivatives their strength, but they also carry significant risks, particularly if the market shifts against a trader&#8217;s predictions.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-derivatives-trading" dir="ltr">Pros &amp; Cons of Derivatives Trading</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">Pros</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">Risk Management and Hedging Options</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives are effective risk management instruments that allow investors to hedge against unfavourable price movements in the underlying assets. For example, a corporation facing foreign currency risk could use currency futures to lock in a favourable exchange rate, reducing the financial impact of future currency fluctuations.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Amplified Returns through Leverage</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Traders may control massive holdings with a modest investment by using leverage on derivatives. This enables companies to generate more significant returns from a lower initial investment, allowing them to capitalise on market movements without requiring substantial upfront cash.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Market Access and Diversification</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives provide access to a variety of markets, such as commodities, currencies, interest rates, and equity indices, allowing for diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds. This diversification decreases investment risk by exposing you to a wide range of asset classes, each of which may react differently to economic conditions.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Enhanced Market Efficiency</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The derivatives market is crucial for determining prices, as the prices of derivatives frequently signal anticipated future values of the underlying assets. For example, stock options can reveal the market&#8217;s perspective on a stock&#8217;s expected volatility, aiding investors in making better-informed choices.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Income Generation through Option Premiums</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Selling options (such as covered calls) allow investors to earn an income from the premium received, which can supplement returns and improve overall portfolio performance. This income generation is appropriate in relatively stable markets, where the likelihood of options being exercised is lower, providing a steady cash flow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/trading-accounts/demo-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-45551 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality-1024x256.jpg" alt="Demo-White-High-Quality" width="800" height="200" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Cons</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">High risk due to leverage</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Although leverage can increase your earnings, it also significantly increases the possibility of loss, making derivatives risky for people with no expertise. A slightly negative price movement in a leveraged position can result in significant financial losses, potentially exceeding the initial investment.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Complexity and Knowledge Requirements</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives are complex financial instruments requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying assets, contract terms, and market circumstances. Furthermore, concepts like the &#8220;Greeks&#8221; of options (which evaluate price reaction to market movements) add complexity that inexperienced traders may find difficult to grasp.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Counterparty Risk in OTC Derivatives</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are privately negotiated, exposing traders to risk if the counterparty fails to meet their contractual obligations. Unlike exchange-traded derivatives, which use intermediaries to reduce risk, OTC derivatives rely on each participant&#8217;s creditworthiness, adding another risk layer.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Sensitivity to Market Volatility</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives&#8217; values can vary quickly owing to changes in the underlying asset prices, making them highly vulnerable to market swings. This sensitivity suggests that trading derivatives for speculative purposes could result in large profits or losses quickly, particularly in volatile assets like commodities and currencies.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="6">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="derivatives-trading-strategies" dir="ltr">Derivatives Trading Strategies</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Traders use several ways to increase their earnings or reduce their risk exposure in derivatives trading. Here are four popular strategies:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hedging: Hedging entails utilising derivatives to mitigate potential losses in a primary investment. For example, a coffee vendor expecting price increases may purchase coffee futures to lock in current lower prices and limit cost volatility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speculation: Speculative tactics attempt to appropriately forecast swings in asset values and trade derivatives. For example, if a trader believes gold prices will climb, they may buy a call option on gold, allowing them to profit if the price does rise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Arbitrage: This approach seeks to profit on price differences across related assets or marketplaces by buying a derivative in one market and selling it in another. For example, traders may purchase an investment in one country&#8217;s market and sell it for a higher price in another, benefitting from the difference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pairs Trading: Investors may maintain opposite positions in two closely linked assets to profit from performance variances. For example, a trader may shorten an airline stock while going long on an oil company, anticipating that changes in oil prices will affect the two businesses differently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each approach requires a unique risk management methodology, and knowing these strategies is crucial for successfully navigating the derivatives market.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/trading-accounts/live-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-45552 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Live-Black-High-Quality-1024x256.jpg" alt="Live-Black-High-Quality" width="800" height="200" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Live-Black-High-Quality-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Live-Black-High-Quality-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Live-Black-High-Quality-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Live-Black-High-Quality.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>

<h2 id="conclusion" dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Derivative trading effectively controls risk, facilitates market exposure, and increases returns. While corporations and institutions use them widely, derivatives also appeal to individual traders seeking advanced strategies. However, investing in derivatives trading carries significant risks, most notably the possibility of sustaining magnified losses. Individuals new to trading derivatives must first gather information and carefully establish their methods to achieve both success and safety in their trading attempts.</p>

<h2 style="line-height: 2;">How to Start Trading Online</h2>
</section>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Engaging in <strong><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-start-trading-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online trading</a></strong> necessitates meticulous preparation and a comprehensive understanding of the process. The following is a detailed explanation of the recommended steps for beginner traders:</p>
<ol style="line-height: 2;">
<li><strong>Find an Online Broker</strong>: Conduct research to select an online broker that aligns with your trading requirements. Look for brokers offering low fees, user-friendly platforms, and comprehensive customer support. Compare offers and terms of service from different brokers to make an informed decision. Ensure that the chosen broker provides valuable resources to support your trading journey.</li>
<li><strong>Create and Fund Your Trading Account</strong>: Open a trading account once a broker is chosen. Decide between a cash account, where personal funds are used for trading, or a margin account, which enables borrowing from the broker using existing stocks as collateral. Regardless of the account type, providing a certain percentage of the stock&#8217;s value may be necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Decide on a Trade Strategy</strong>: Determine your trade goals and develop a strategy. Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of various strategies, such as day trading, scalping, swing trading, or long-term investing. Seek advice from professionals or consult reliable trading resources to make well-informed decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Practice With an Online Trading Simulator</strong>: Utilise an online trading simulator to gain experience and confidence before engaging in real-money trading. These simulators replicate the stock market environment, allowing practice in buying and selling stocks without financial risk. Using a simulator, you can better understand market dynamics, technical analysis, and the consequences of your trading decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Make Your Trade</strong>: Once you feel comfortable with the trading process, begin executing trades. Start by obtaining real-time stock quotes from your broker&#8217;s platform, which displays current prices and stock availability. Choose between market orders and limit orders for your trades.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li><strong>Market Order</strong>: Executes the trade immediately at the prevailing market price.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Order</strong>: You can specify a particular price at which you wish to buy or sell a stock. The trade will only be executed if the stock reaches a better price.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For beginners, it is generally advised to use limit orders as they provide better control and help mitigate potential losses. Furthermore, online trading platforms may offer additional order types, such as stop-loss orders, stop-limit orders, and trailing stop-loss orders:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li><strong>Stop-Loss Order</strong>: Activated when the stock price falls below a specific &#8220;stop price.&#8221; It then becomes a market order executed at the prevailing price.</li>
<li><strong>Stop-Limit Order</strong>: Combines a stop order and a limit order. When the stop price is reached, it becomes a limit order to be executed at the limit price or better. However, there is no guarantee that the limit will be matched, and the order may need to be completed.</li>
<li><strong>Trailing Stop-Loss Order</strong>: Allows you to set a maximum percentage of loss you are willing to tolerate during a trade. If the stock value moves in your favour, the stop price adjusts accordingly. However, it remains unchanged if the stock value decreases.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Following these steps and familiarising yourself with different order types, you can embark on your online trading journey with enhanced confidence and control. Remember to continually educate yourself, adapt your strategies, and stay updated with market trends to improve your trading skills over time.</p>

<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages of Online Trading</h3>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li>Volatility: The market is volatile, meaning prices can go up and down quickly. This means that traders could lose money if the market moves against them.</li>
<li>Scams: There are many scams, so it is important to research and only trade with reputable brokers.</li>
<li>Emotional Trading: It is easy to make emotional decisions when trading, which can lead to losses. It is important to stay calm and make rational decisions.</li>

</ul>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Remember that there is no guarantee of success in online trading. Even if you do your research and make informed decisions, there is always the possibility of losing money. Therefore, it is important to only invest what you can afford to lose.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">If you are new to online trading, it is a good idea to start with a small amount of money and learn the ropes before investing more. There are many resources available online and through your broker that can help you learn about online trading.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Once you have a better understanding of online trading, you can start to develop a strategy that meets your individual goals. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to online trading. What works for one person may not work for another. Therefore, experiment and find what works best for you.</p>

<h3 style="line-height: 2;">Online Trading Instruments</h3>
</section>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Stocks</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy stocks, you become a part-owner of that company. The value of stocks can be influenced by various factors, including company performance, industry trends, and market sentiment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Cryptocurrencies</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptography for security. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency values can be highly volatile and are influenced by factors such as adoption, technological developments, and regulatory changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">ETFs are baskets of stocks or other assets that are traded on an exchange like stocks. They provide investors with diversified exposure to various markets or sectors. The value of ETFs can be influenced by the performance of the underlying assets they hold.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Bonds</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Bonds are loans that you make to a company or government. When you buy a bond, you are lending money to that entity, and they agree to pay you back with interest. Bond prices can be affected by interest rates, credit ratings, and economic conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Commodities</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Commodities are raw materials like oil, gold, and silver. You can trade these commodities on futures exchanges. The prices of commodities can be influenced by supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and macroeconomic trends.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">It is important to note that trading financial assets is a risky endeavour and you could lose money. It is important to do your research and understand the risks involved before you start trading.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Overall, online trading is a more convenient, faster, and cheaper way to trade securities than offline trading. It is also a more transparent and educational experience.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Here are some of the risks you should be aware of:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li><strong>Volatility</strong>: The stock market is volatile, and stock prices can fluctuate wildly. This means you could lose a lot of money quickly. For example, in 2020, the stock market lost nearly 30% of its value in the first quarter, but then recovered to reach record highs by the end of the year.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud</strong>: There are many scams and fraudulent activities associated with online trading. Be careful who you invest with. Some common scams include pump-and-dump schemes, where scammers artificially inflate the price of a stock and then sell their shares at a profit, and phishing attacks, where scammers try to steal your personal information in order to access your online accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of knowledge</strong>: You need to understand the stock market and trading principles before you start investing. Otherwise, you&#8217;re likely to lose money. There are many resources available to help you learn about investing, such as online courses, books, and articles.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage and margin trading</strong>: These can amplify your profits, but they can also amplify your losses. Leverage is a loan that allows you to buy more shares than you could afford with your own money. Margin trading is similar to leverage, but it allows you to borrow money from your broker to buy shares.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity threats</strong>: Online trading involves sharing personal and financial information over the internet. This makes you vulnerable to hackers and identity thieves. Be sure to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect your accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional bias</strong>: Your emotions can affect your trading decisions. Be careful not to let fear, greed, or overconfidence lead you to make bad decisions. It is important to have a plan and stick to it, even when the market is volatile.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of regulation</strong>: Some online trading platforms are not regulated. This means there is less protection for investors. Be sure to do your research and only invest with reputable companies.</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Online trading can be a risky undertaking, but it can also be a rewarding one for well-informed and disciplined investors.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">To mitigate the risks, individuals interested in online trading should know which are the best brokers in the market:</p>

<h2 style="line-height: 2;">Factors To Consider When Choosing Investments</h2>
</section>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li>Your level of experience as an investor. If you are a beginner, you may want to start with a smaller amount of money and invest in more stable assets. As you gain experience, you can gradually increase the amount of money you invest and invest in riskier assets.</li>
<li>The amount of money you are investing. If you are investing a small amount of money, you may want to choose investments that are more likely to generate a profit, even if the potential return is lower. If you are investing a large amount of money, you may be able to afford to take on more risk in order to potentially earn a higher return.</li>
<li>Your trading style. If you are a long-term investor, you may want to invest in assets that are likely to appreciate in value over time. If you are a short-term trader, you may want to invest in assets that are more volatile and can be bought and sold quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p style="line-height: 2;">Online trading allows you to buy and sell securities from the comfort of your own home without the need for a broker. This has made investing in the stock market more accessible to people of all income levels.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">To get started with online trading, you need to open an account with a brokerage firm. There are many different brokerage firms to choose from, so it&#8217;s important to compare their fees and services before opening an account. Some of the factors you should consider when choosing a brokerage firm include:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li><strong>Fees</strong>: Brokerage firms charge fees for their services, so it&#8217;s important to compare the fees of different firms before opening an account.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>: Brokerage firms offer different services, so it&#8217;s important to choose a firm that offers the services you need.</li>
<li><strong>Reputation</strong>: It&#8217;s important to choose a brokerage firm with a good reputation. You can research the reputation of a firm by reading online reviews and talking to other investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Once you have opened an account, you can start trading stocks, bonds, and other securities. You can also trade forex currencies, futures, and options. If you&#8217;re new to investing, it&#8217;s a good idea to talk to a financial advisor before you start trading online.</p>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li>Conduct thorough research before you start trading. This includes understanding the different types of investments, the risks involved, and the fees charged by brokers.</li>
<li>Only invest money that you can afford to lose. There is always the possibility of losing money when trading.</li>
<li>Diversify your portfolio by investing in a variety of different assets to reduce your risk.</li>
<li>Monitor your investments regularly to identify any problems early on.</li>
<li>Be patient and do not try to time the market. It is very difficult to buy or sell at the perfect time.</li>
<li>Do not panic if the market goes down. The market will go up and down over time.</li>
<li>Do not chase losses by trying to make up for lost money by investing in riskier assets.</li>
<li>Take profits when you can by selling your investments when they have made a profit.</li>
<li>Have a plan for when you want to sell your investments to avoid making emotional decisions.</li>

<h3 style="line-height: 2;">Day Trading</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Day trading is a type of short-term trading that involves buying and selling securities on the same day. It is a high-risk, high-reward activity that can be very profitable if done correctly. However, it is important to remember that day trading is also very risky, and there is a high chance of losing money.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Before engaging in day trading, it is important to have a sound strategy in place. This strategy should include a plan for how you will identify opportunities in the market, how you will enter and exit trades, and how you will manage your risk.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Day traders typically use technical analysis to identify opportunities in the market. Technical analysis is the study of past price movements in order to predict future price movements. Day traders may also use fundamental analysis to assess the long-term prospects of a particular security. However, day traders are primarily concerned with short-term price movements.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Day trading can be a very profitable activity, but it is important to remember that it is also very risky.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;"><strong>Risks associated with day trading include:</strong></p>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> Day traders capitalise on short-term price movements, and the market&#8217;s volatility can work in their favour. However, it can also lead to sudden and substantial price fluctuations that may result in unexpected losses. Markets can be influenced by economic data releases, geopolitical events, and other unpredictable factors, making it essential for day traders to stay updated and be prepared for sudden market shifts.</li>
<li><strong>High Transaction Costs:</strong> Day traders execute multiple trades throughout the day, and the frequent buying and selling can lead to higher transaction costs, such as brokerage fees and commissions. These costs can eat into profits, particularly for small gains on individual trades. Managing transaction costs is crucial for day traders to ensure that their overall strategy remains profitable.</li>
<li><strong>Time Commitment and Stress:</strong> Day trading requires constant attention to the market and quick decision-making. Traders must be fully dedicated to monitoring price movements, news, and technical indicators throughout the trading session. This level of intensity can lead to significant stress and mental fatigue, affecting a trader&#8217;s ability to make rational decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Overtrading:</strong> The fast-paced nature of day trading can tempt traders to overtrade – making too many trades in a short period. Overtrading can lead to impulsive and ill-considered decisions, increasing the likelihood of losses. Having a disciplined approach and sticking to a well-defined trading plan is essential to avoid overtrading.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological Challenges:</strong> Day trading can be emotionally demanding, and traders must manage their emotions effectively. Fear of missing out (FOMO) and the fear of loss can lead to rash decisions. Conversely, overconfidence can make traders take unnecessary risks. Emotion-driven trading can lead to significant losses, making emotional control and discipline crucial for day traders.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Diversification:</strong> Day traders often focus on a few select securities or asset classes due to the limited time frame. This lack of diversification can expose them to concentrated risks in case of adverse price movements in those specific assets. Diversifying a trading portfolio can help mitigate the impact of single security losses on overall performance.</li>
<li><strong>Overnight Risk:</strong> Day trading involves closing all positions before the end of the trading day, avoiding overnight exposure to market risks. Overnight risk arises when unexpected events occur outside trading hours that can lead to significant gaps in prices when the market opens the next day. Traders may wake up to substantial losses due to such events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 2;">If you are considering day trading, researching and understanding the risks involved is essential. You should also develop a sound <strong><a href="http://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk management</a></strong> strategy and only trade with money you can afford to lose.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 2;">Position Trading</h3>
<p>Position trading is a longer-term trading strategy that involves adopting a patient approach to capturing major market trends. Some key features and characteristics of position trading include:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Perspective:</strong> Position traders focus on identifying strong and sustainable trends that have the potential to generate substantial profits over time.</li>
<li><strong>Riding Market Trends:</strong> Traders aim to enter positions when a new trend begins and exit when prices reach their peak, capitalizing on the full trend movement.</li>
<li><strong>Fundamental Analysis:</strong> Position traders rely on fundamental analysis to make informed investment decisions based on factors like financials, industry outlook, and macroeconomic trends.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Frequency of Trades:</strong> Position trading involves fewer trades to minimize transaction costs and reduce the emotional stress associated with frequent trading.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Position traders employ risk management techniques, such as stop-loss orders and position sizing, to protect their capital.</li>
<li><strong>Less Time-Intensive:</strong> Position trading requires less time and monitoring compared to day or swing trading.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological Resilience:</strong> Successful position traders need psychological resilience to weather market fluctuations and remain committed to their investment thesis.</li>
<li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Position traders often diversify their portfolios to spread risk across different assets or industries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 2;"><strong>Note:</strong> It&#8217;s essential to remember that position trading is not without risks. Holding positions for an extended period exposes traders to factors such as economic shifts, changing market dynamics, and unexpected events that could influence the asset&#8217;s price. Therefore, thorough research, a solid understanding of market fundamentals, and a disciplined approach to risk management are essential for successful position trading. This strategy is best suited for patient investors who have a long-term investment horizon and can withstand market fluctuations without succumbing to impulsive decisions.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 2;">Swing Trading</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2;">When we first discussed stock trading, we emphasised that it should always be based on market trend analysis. Swing trading takes advantage of this information by capitalising on price swings during certain stages of a market movement to maximise profits once a trend gains momentum. Successful swing trading relies on predicting a trend&#8217;s performance and profiting from its volatility.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Swing traders typically hold positions for a few days to a few weeks, and they may enter and exit multiple trades during a single trend. They use technical analysis to identify trends and entry and exit points and often use stop-loss orders to protect their profits.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Swing trading can be a profitable strategy, but it is also a risky one. Traders need to identify trends accurately and manage their risk effectively. They also need to be prepared to lose money on some trades.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">If you are considering swing trading, it is important to research and understand the risks involved. You should also develop a trading plan that outlines your goals, strategies, and risk management rules.</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 2; font-weight: normal;">Second-Based Contract Trading: A Different Approach</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2;">In addition to the traditional trading strategies mentioned above, another popular trading method is Contract for Difference (SPC) trading. Second Contract trading provides investors with a unique way to speculate on the price movements of various financial instruments without owning the underlying assets. Let&#8217;s delve into how Second Contract trading works and its key characteristics:</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 2; font-weight: normal;">Second-Based Contract Trading Explained</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Second Contract, short for Contract for Difference, enables traders to profit from both rising and falling markets. Instead of owning the actual asset, traders enter into a contract with a broker to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset, such as stocks, commodities, currencies, or indices. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the process:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol style="line-height: 2;">
<li><strong>Selecting an Asset</strong>: Similar to other trading strategies, Second Contract traders choose the financial instrument they want to trade, ranging from stocks and indices to cryptocurrencies and commodities.</li>
<li><strong>Opening a Position</strong>: Traders decide whether they anticipate the asset&#8217;s price will rise (long position) or fall (short position). This decision forms the basis of the Second Contract contract they enter into with the broker.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage</strong>: Second Contract trading often involves leverage, allowing traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. Leverage can amplify profits, but it also magnifies potential losses, so traders need to approach it cautiously.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring the Trade</strong>: As the market price of the underlying asset moves, the value of the Second Contract position changes accordingly. Traders can choose to exit the position at any time, aiming to capitalize on price fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Closing the Position</strong>: Closing a Second Contract position involves executing the opposite trade to the one initially opened. This action locks in the difference between the opening and closing prices, determining the trader&#8217;s profit or loss.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Second Contract trading platforms offer tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage risk. These tools help traders automatically close positions at predetermined points to limit losses or secure profits.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits and Risks of Second-Based Contract Trading</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2;">While Second Contract trading offers unique advantages, including the ability to profit from both upward and downward price movements, it also comes with inherent risks:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li><strong>Leverage Risk</strong>: Leverage can magnify both profits and losses, potentially resulting in significant financial swings based on small market movements.</li>
<li><strong>Market Risk</strong>: Second Contract prices track the underlying market, exposing traders to market risks, including volatility and unexpected price shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Counterparty Risk</strong>: Second Contract trading involves a contract with the broker. If the broker faces financial trouble, there&#8217;s a risk traders might not receive their profits.</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong>: Second Contract traders don&#8217;t own the underlying asset, which means they don&#8217;t have ownership rights or associated benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="line-height: 2; font-weight: normal;">Integrating Second-Based Contract Trading with Other Strategies</h4>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Just like day trading, swing trading, and position trading, Second Contract trading is a distinct approach that requires careful research, analysis, and risk management. Traders should consider their risk tolerance, knowledge, and investment goals before engaging in Second Contract trading. It&#8217;s crucial to practice with a demo account and start with only what they can afford to lose.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;">In conclusion, Second Contract trading offers a dynamic alternative to traditional trading strategies, allowing investors to engage in speculative trading without owning the underlying assets.</p>
<h4 style="line-height: 2;">Scalping</h4>
<p style="line-height: 2;"><strong><a href="http://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/best-forex-pairs-for-scalpers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scalping</a></strong> is a short-term strategy that takes advantage of the minor price differences created by the bidding-asking spread. In this case, you profit by selling securities at a higher asking price than the purchase price.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2; text-align: left;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; width: 403px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: right;" src="https://6693213.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/6693213/hubfs/ATFX-beginner-forex-trading-1.webp?width=403&amp;height=208&amp;name=ATFX-beginner-forex-trading-1.webp" alt="beginner-forex-trading" width="403" height="208" /></strong></p>
<h3 style="line-height: 2;">Tips for Beginner Online Traders</h3>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
<li>Start Small: Only invest what you can afford to lose.</li>
<li>Do Your Research: Learn about the different types of investments and how the market works.</li>
<li>Have a Trading Plan: Set realistic goals and stick to your plan, even when the market is volatile.</li>
<li>Do Not Get Emotional: Stay calm and make rational decisions.</li>
<li>Take Breaks: Do not trade when you are tired or stressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="line-height: 2;">Conclusion</h2>

</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Margin, in the context of Forex trading, is often misunderstood as a fee or a direct cost. In reality, margin is best described as a security deposit that traders provide to their brokers. It acts as collateral, allowing traders to access larger capital amounts for their trades, which amplifies their potential profits and losses.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When you decide to trade on margin, you&#8217;re essentially entering into a short-term loan agreement with your broker. The loan allows you to trade larger positions than you could solely with your own capital. The margin requirement, typically expressed as a percentage, represents the portion of the full trade value you must have in your trading account.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Imagine you&#8217;re interested in trading the GBP/USD currency pair. Let&#8217;s say the current price of GBP/USD is 1.3000. If you wish to trade one standard lot, which is 100,000 units, without margin, you&#8217;d need the full value of the trade, i.e., $130,000. However, with a broker offering a 1% margin requirement, you&#8217;d only need to deposit $1,300 into your account to open the same position. This means you&#8217;re controlling a $130,000 position with just $1,300 of your own money.

<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Leverage vs Margin: What’s the Difference?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">While both leverage and margin are integral to Forex trading, they serve different purposes and are not synonymous.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Leverage refers to the ability to control a large trade position using a relatively small amount of capital. It is often expressed as a ratio, such as 100:1, which means that for every $1 of your capital, you can control a position worth $100. Learn more about <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-leverage-in-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what is leverage in trading </a>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Margin, on the other hand, is the actual amount of money required to open a leveraged position. It acts as a security deposit and is based on the leverage ratio offered by the broker.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To illustrate, using the previous example with the GBP/USD pair, If a broker offers 100:1 leverage, this means you can control a $130,000 position with just $1,300 (which is the 1% margin requirement). The leverage determines the size of the trade position you can control, while the margin determines how much you need to open that position.</span></p>

<h2 id="how-does-margin-work" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">How Does Margin in Forex Work?</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Trading on margin is similar to using leverage in the financial markets. When you use margin, you&#8217;re essentially borrowing capital from your broker to control a larger position. This allows traders to amplify their exposure to the market without committing the full capital required for a trade.</span></p>
<ol type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What is Margin Requirement &amp; Required Margin?</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Margin Requirement</strong> is the percentage of the total trade value that a broker requires a trader to deposit into their account to open a leveraged position. It is regarded as a safety net for the broker as it ensures that traders have enough capital to cover their potential losses. Learn <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/choose-which-broker-is-best">how to choose a broker</a>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Required Margin</strong>, on the other hand, is the actual dollar amount needed to open a position. It&#8217;s derived by multiplying the margin requirement (as a percentage) with the total position size.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you wish to trade a position worth $100,000 and your broker has a margin requirement of 2%, the required margin would be 2% of $100,000, which is $2,000. This is the amount you need to deposit to open that position.</span></p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">How to Calculate Margin in Forex</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To calculate the margin in Forex, you simply multiply the margin requirement by the total position size. The formula is:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Margin = Total Position Size x Margin Requirement</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Using the above example, if you&#8217;re trading $100,000 with a 2% margin requirement, the margin would be:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Margin = $100,000 x 0.02 = $2,000</span></p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Why are Margin Calculations Important?</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Margin calculations play a pivotal role in forex trading for several reasons:</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Risk Management:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Knowing the margin requirement helps traders understand how much capital they need to allocate for a trade, ensuring they don&#8217;t overextend themselves.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Trade Size Determination:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">By understanding margin calculations, traders can determine the maximum position size they can control based on their available capital.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Avoiding Margin Calls:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Regularly calculating and monitoring used and free margin helps traders avoid margin calls, ensuring they always have enough capital in their accounts to cover potential losses.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27026" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/how-to-calculate-margin-in-forex.webp" alt="how to calculate margin in forex" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/how-to-calculate-margin-in-forex.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/how-to-calculate-margin-in-forex-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/how-to-calculate-margin-in-forex-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/how-to-calculate-margin-in-forex-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Consider a scenario where you believe the EUR/JPY currency pair, currently priced at 130.00, is set to rise. You decide to buy one standard lot, equivalent to 100,000 units. Without margin, you&#8217;d need the full value of the trade, which is 13,000,000 yen (or its equivalent in your base currency). However, with a 2% margin requirement, you&#8217;d only need to deposit 260,000 yen to open this position. This means you&#8217;re controlling a 13,000,000 yen position with just 260,000 yen of your own funds.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">As the price of the EUR/JPY pair moves, the profits or losses are magnified based on the full value of the trade, not just the margin you&#8217;ve deposited. If EUR/JPY rises to 131.00, you&#8217;d make a profit based on the full 100,000 units, not just the 2% margin you&#8217;ve put up.</span></p>

<h2 id="types-of-margin" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Types of Margin in Forex</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">As a Forex trader, understanding the different types of margin is a crucial part of effective risk management. Margin isn&#8217;t just a one-size-fits-all concept; there are specific types of margins that traders should be aware of, each serving a unique purpose in the trading process.</span></p>
<ol type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Free Margin:</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Free margin refers to the amount of money in a trading account that remains available to open new positions. It acts as a buffer or cushion, representing the funds not currently tied up in active trades. The free margin is calculated by subtracting the margin used for open positions from the total equity (balance + or &#8211; any profit or loss from open positions).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Imagine you have a total of $10,000 in your trading account. Without any open positions, your entire balance is considered your free margin, allowing you flexibility in deciding how much of it to use for trading.</span></p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Initial Margin:</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The initial margin, often termed the &#8220;entry margin,&#8221; signifies the minimum amount of capital required to open a new trading position. It&#8217;s essentially a security deposit, ensuring traders have sufficient funds to cover potential losses from the outset of their trade.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Suppose you&#8217;re keen on trading the USD/CAD currency pair, currently priced at 1.2500. If you&#8217;re aiming to trade one standard lot (100,000 units) and your broker mandates a 1% initial margin requirement, you&#8217;d need to set aside $1,250 as your initial margin to commence the trade.</span></p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Maintenance Margin:</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Maintenance margin is the minimum amount of money traders must retain in their trading account to keep a position open. If the account balance dips below this level due to unfavourable market movements, a margin call is triggered, urging traders to either deposit more funds or close out positions to meet the requirement.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Continuing with the USD/CAD scenario, if the broker&#8217;s maintenance margin is set at 0.5%, for your trade of one standard lot, you must always maintain at least $625 in your account. Should a market downturn cause your balance to drop below this threshold, a margin call would be initiated.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">By understanding these different types of margins, traders can effectively manage their funds, optimize their <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading strategies </a>, and safeguard against potential losses in the Forex market.</span></p>

</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A margin call is one of the most crucial concepts in Forex trading that every trader should be well-acquainted with.</span></p>
<ol type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What is a margin call ?</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A margin call is a critical alert in the world of <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forex trading </a>. It acts as a protective mechanism for both the broker and the trader, ensuring that trading accounts do not go into a negative balance due to adverse market movements.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When trading on margin, traders essentially use borrowed funds from their broker to control larger positions. The broker will issue a margin call if the market moves against a trader&#8217;s position and the account balance approaches the maintenance margin. This is an alert or a demand from the broker for the trader to either deposit additional funds into their account or close some or all of their open positions to restore the account balance to the required maintenance margin level.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27027" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/what-is-margin-call.webp" alt="what is margin call" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/what-is-margin-call.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/what-is-margin-call-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/what-is-margin-call-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/what-is-margin-call-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Imagine you, as a trader, have an account balance of $5,000. You decide to open a position in the EUR/USD pair with a 1% margin requirement, controlling a position worth $100,000. This means you use $1,000 of your balance as the initial margin.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">However, unexpected news causes the EUR/USD pair to move against your position. As the losses mount, your account balance drops to $3,500. If your broker has a maintenance margin of 0.5% (or $500 for your position), and considering your initial margin of $1,000, you&#8217;re left with only $2,500 as a buffer. If the losses continue and your free margin approaches the maintenance margin level, the broker will issue a margin call.

<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Consequences of a Margin Call</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The immediate consequence of a margin call is that the trader must act swiftly. They have a few options:</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deposit Additional Funds:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This is the most straightforward solution. By adding more money to the trading account, the trader can meet the margin requirements and keep their positions open.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Close Some or All Open Positions:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">By closing positions, especially those that are not performing well, the trader can release the used margin and restore their account balance.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Broker Intervention:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If the trader doesn&#8217;t act in time, the broker might automatically close some or all of the trader&#8217;s positions to prevent further losses. This is known as a &#8220;stop out,&#8221; and the specific level at which this occurs varies by broker.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Regularly monitor your account balance, margin level, and market news that might impact your positions.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Use Stop-Loss Orders:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This allows you to set a predetermined level at which your position will automatically close, limiting potential losses.</span></p>

<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Trade Conservatively:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Especially if you&#8217;re a beginner, it&#8217;s wise not to use the maximum leverage available. Start with lower leverage until you&#8217;re more experienced.</span></p>

</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Different brokers have varying margin requirements. You must familiarize yourself with these requirements and ensure you always have enough capital in your account to meet them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27032" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/margin-requirement.webp" alt="margin requirement" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/margin-requirement.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/margin-requirement-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/margin-requirement-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/margin-requirement-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Two brokers might offer different leverage ratios, such as 50:1 and 100:1. While the latter allows you to control a larger position with the same amount of capital, it also increases the risk. If you deposit $1,000, a 1% adverse move with 50:1 leverage could result in a $500 loss, but with 100:1 leverage, that same move could result in a $1,000 loss.

</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A stop-loss order automatically closes a position once it reaches a predetermined price level, limiting potential losses. It is a safety net that ensures you don&#8217;t lose more than you&#8217;re willing to risk.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you open a position in the GBP/USD pair at 1.3000 and set a stop-loss at 1.2950, your trade will automatically close if the price drops to 1.2950, limiting your loss to 50 pips.

</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Simply because you can control a large trade position with a small amount of capital doesn&#8217;t mean you should. Overleveraging can trigger significant losses. Determine a leverage level that is aligned with your risk tolerance.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Even if your broker offers 200:1 leverage, it might be prudent to use only 50:1 or even less, especially if you&#8217;re new to trading or uncertain about market conditions.

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Always ensure you have enough free margin in your account. This acts as a buffer against adverse market movements and reduces the likelihood of a margin call.</span></p>

<h2 id="benefits-and-risks-of-trading-on-margin" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Benefits and Risks of Trading on Margin</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Trading on margin amplifies both the potential rewards and risks of the Forex market. By understanding these dual aspects, traders can make informed decisions and strategize effectively.</span></p>
<ol type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Benefits of Trading on Margin:</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Increased Buying Power:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Margin trading allows you to control large trade positions with less capital. Therefore, this means that even with limited funds, you can gain exposure to a significant position in the market.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Flexibility:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Margin provides traders with the flexibility to maximise their trading opportunities without having to deposit the full value of each trade.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Potential for Higher Returns:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Since you&#8217;re controlling a larger position, even small market movements can result in significant profits. This leverage can amplify your returns relative to your initial investment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Suppose you have $2,000 in your trading account. With a 1% margin requirement, you can control a position worth $200,000. If the currency pair you&#8217;re trading moves in your favour by just 1%, instead of making a $20 profit (1% of $2,000), you stand to gain $2,000 (1% of $200,000) due to the power of leverage. Learn <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-trade-forex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to trade forex</a>.</span></p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Risks of Trading on Margin:</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Margin Calls:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If your account balance falls below the maintenance margin, you&#8217;ll face a margin call, which may force you to deposit additional funds or close positions at a loss.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Interest Charges:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Some brokers charge interest on the money you borrow to open a margin position. Over time, these charges can accumulate, especially if you hold positions open for extended periods.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Potential for Higher Losses:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Just as margin trading can amplify profits can be amplified, it can also magnify losses can be magnified. If the market moves against your trade position, you can lose a significant amount portion or even all of your initial investment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Continuing from the previous example, if the currency pair moves against your position by 1%, instead of losing just $20, you could lose $2,000 due to the leveraged nature of the trade. This is a significant portion of your initial capital, highlighting the risks involved.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Forex, or foreign exchange, is the global arena for trading national currencies in pairs like the EUR/USD. It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s largest financial market, with a daily volume exceeding $6 trillion. Currencies are categorised as major, minor, or exotic pairs.

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> when the EUR/USD rate shifts from 1.10 to 1.15, a transaction of €100,000 could mean a $5,000 difference due to the rate change. This market operates 24/5, driven by banks, institutions, and individual traders.

<h2 id="what-is-stock-trading" dir="ltr">What is Stock Trading?</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Stock trading involves buying and selling shares of publicly listed companies on stock exchanges. These shares represent fractional ownership in the company. As of 2021, the global stock market capitalisation reached approximately $95 trillion.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25024" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/what-is-stock-trading-apple-stock.webp" alt="what is stock trading - apple stock" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/what-is-stock-trading-apple-stock.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/what-is-stock-trading-apple-stock-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/what-is-stock-trading-apple-stock-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/what-is-stock-trading-apple-stock-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> if someone had purchased 10 shares of Apple in 2000 for around $3 each, their investment would be worth $99,394.40 in 2023, given the stock splits and price appreciation. Stock traders aim to capitalise on short-term market movements, while investors often hold long-term, banking on company growth.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Here are more detailed descriptions of each difference, with examples and figures:</p>
<ol type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Market Structure</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Forex:</span> It&#8217;s a decentralised market, meaning there isn&#8217;t a central exchange. Instead, trading occurs directly between participants over-the-counter (OTC).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Stocks:</span> Stocks are traded on centralised exchanges, such as the NYSE, NASDAQ, or Tokyo Stock Exchange. This centralisation provides more transparency in terms of price and volume data.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24988" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/forex-vs-stocks-decentralised-vs-centralised-market-structure.webp" alt="forex vs stocks - decentralised vs centralised market structure" width="548" height="283" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> When buying a stock, you purchase it from a seller on a specific exchange. In Forex, you could be trading with various participants, from banks to individual traders, without a centralised location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Ownership:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Forex:</span> When trading currencies, you don&#8217;t own the actual currency. You&#8217;re speculating on its future value against another currency.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Stocks:</span> Buying a stock means purchasing a piece of ownership in a company. As a shareholder, you may have voting rights and might receive dividends.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> Owning Apple stock means you own a tiny fraction of Apple Inc. and might receive dividends. Trading the EUR/USD pair doesn&#8217;t give you ownership of euros or dollars; you&#8217;re speculating on their relative values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Short Selling:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Forex:</span> It&#8217;s inherently a two-sided market. When you believe a currency’s value will rise, you buy or &#8220;go long.&#8221; When you think it will decrease, you sell or &#8220;go short.&#8221; Going short is as straightforward as going long.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Stocks:</span> While you can short-sell stocks, the process is more involved. It requires borrowing shares to sell them at the current price, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> If you believe the Japanese yen will weaken against the U.S. dollar, you can easily sell the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-trade-usdjpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD/JPY pair </a>. But if you think a stock like Tesla will drop, you&#8217;d need to borrow shares to short sell, which might come with restrictions or additional costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Dividends and Interest:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Forex:</span> Traders might earn or pay interest based on the difference in interest rates between the two currencies in a pair, known as the &#8220;rollover&#8221; or &#8220;swap&#8221; rate.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24989" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/forex-vs-stocks-interest-rates.webp" alt="forex vs stocks - interest rates" width="1200" height="620" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Stocks:</span> If a company shares profits with its shareholders, stock investors might receive dividends. Forex traders don&#8217;t receive dividends.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24991" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/forex-vs-stocks-dividends.webp" alt="forex vs stocks - dividends" width="1200" height="620" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> Holding Microsoft shares might earn you dividends when the company distributes profits. Holding the EUR/USD pair overnight could result in either earning or paying interest, depending on the interest rate differential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Stocks:</span> Trading hours are limited to the specific stock exchange&#8217;s operating hours, typically from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time for exchanges like the NYSE.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25029" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stock-trading-hours.webp" alt="stock trading hours" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stock-trading-hours.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stock-trading-hours-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stock-trading-hours-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stock-trading-hours-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Volume and Liquidity:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Forex:</span> Extremely high liquidity due to its global nature, with a daily trading volume exceeding $6 trillion as of 2019.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Stocks:</span> Liquidity varies by stock and exchange. Blue-chip stocks like Apple or Microsoft tend to have high liquidity, while smaller stocks may not.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Figures:</span> The NYSE alone has a daily trading volume of around $200 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">

<h3 dir="ltr">Factors Influencing Prices:</h3>

<h2 id="relationship-between-forex-and-stock-market" dir="ltr">Relationship Between the Forex and Stock Markets</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The Forex and stock markets are two distinct financial realms, but they often influence each other in various ways:</p>
<ol type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Risk Appetite and Safe-Haven Currencies:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">When stock markets are bullish, indicating a high-risk appetite, investors might move away from safe-haven currencies like the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen. Conversely, during stock market downturns, these currencies often strengthen as investors seek safety.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> During times of geopolitical tension or economic uncertainty, investors might sell off stocks and buy safe-haven currencies, leading to a decline in <a href="http://atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stock indices </a>and an appreciation of currencies like the Swiss franc.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Interest Rates and Equity Valuations:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Central bank interest rate decisions can influence the Forex and stock markets. Higher interest rates can strengthen a currency but also impact borrowing costs for companies, potentially affecting their stock valuations.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> When the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it might lead to a surge in the U.S. dollar value. However, companies with significant debt might see their stock prices decline due to increased borrowing costs.

<ol start="3" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Economic Indicators:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Economic data, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and manufacturing output, can influence currency values and stock prices. Strong economic performance can boost a country&#8217;s currency and its stock market.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25035" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/economic-indicators.webp" alt="economic indicators" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/economic-indicators.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/economic-indicators-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/economic-indicators-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/economic-indicators-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Figures:</span> A report showing a 2.4% GDP growth above expectations might lead to a country&#8217;s stock market index rising by several percentage points and its currency strengthening against its peers. Learn more about <a href="http://atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indices trading </a>.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Globalization and Multinational Corporations:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Many companies operate globally, earning revenues in multiple currencies. Fluctuations in currency values can impact these companies&#8217; profitability and, by extension, their stock prices.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span> A U.S.-based multinational earning significant revenues in Europe might see its profits (when converted back to dollars) affected by major swings in the EUR/USD exchange rate.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">There have been hot debates amongst traders over which is the better asset to trade between <a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stocks</a> and <a href="/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indices</a>. The common belief is that Indices remains the more tradeable asset as it combines a group of stocks, making them more volatile. Thus one can easily speculate and predict the direction of a group of stock over extended periods. On the other hand, some stock enthusiasts believe that trading a single stock rather than a group of stocks could be more precise in determining market movement. Well, every trader has got their favourite assets, but what are some exciting facts about Indices?</p>
<p><span id="more-10660"></span></p>
<h2 style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">Why do some prefer Indices?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">Indices measure the price performance of a group of stocks from an exchange. For example, the FTSE 100 tracks the 100 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange. Trading indices undoubtedly enable you to get exposure to an entire economy or sector at once while only opening a single position. They are highly liquid, which gives traders tight spreads and clear chart patterns. Moreover, the <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-a-cfd-and-6-reasons-to-start-trading-index-cfds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Index market</a> is considered more volatile and significant simply because it represents economic health.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>History of Forex Trading</h2>
<p><strong>Forex trading</strong> is a legalized global business of exchanging different world currencies and other financial instruments that ought to be centuries old. Its earliest beginning dates back to the Babylonian period when trading through the barter system was practiced as a means of exchange.</p>
<p>The general conception is that <a href="/en/markets/forex-trading">Forex trading</a> started in Amsterdam roughly 500 years ago. Beginning in Amsterdam, Forex trading then spread further throughout the whole world. Today, the forex market is one of the largest, most liquid and accessible trading <a href="/en/markets">markets</a> globally. The industry had undergone several major shifts in the past, gaining shape through critical global events like the barter system, gold coin standard, Bretton Woods Monetary Conference, and the floating method.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lptemplatedev.wpengine.com/hubfs/ATFX_Hot_Topics_20220317%20(1).webp" alt="forex history" width="609" height="305" /></p>
<h2>History of Currency Trading &amp; Forex Market</h2>
<h3>When did Forex trading start?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Barter System</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The trade by barter system is the oldest method of exchange, dating back to 6000 BC and is often seen as the building block behind the formation of forex trading in the later years. Under the barter system, goods were exchanged for other goods. The plan later evolved, and goods like animal hides and skin, salt and food spices which were of high demand, became popular mediums of exchange. However, the 6th century BC observed the production of gold coins. Thus, gold coins adopted the role of currency for its portability, divisibility, uniformity, limit of supply, namely significant characteristics of money today. Indeed, the concept went on to replace the barter system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Gold Coins Standard</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most countries adopted the gold standard at the tail end of the 18th century. The gold standard guaranteed that the government would pay any amount of paper money for the equal <a href="/en/live-chart/gold-price">price of gold</a>, which worked well until the first World War struck. European countries were forced to suspend the gold standard to fund the war by ramping up printing paper money. Hence the need for each country to develop their fiat currencies arose at this point. Therefore, paper money was bound to be printed by each country as their means of exchange.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Bretton Woods Monetary Conference (1944 – 1971)</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bretton Woods Monetary Conference, held in Bretton, was one of the most significant events in history that helped to standardize the Forex Market as we have today.</p>
<p>After World War II, the G3 comprising the United States, Great Britain, and France met at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods to fashion a new global economic order. The chosen location at the time was simply because the US being the only country not heavily affected by the war. Most of the major European countries were in shambles during this period. WWI transformed the US dollar from a failing currency after the <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-pick-a-stock">stock market</a> crash of 1929 to a yardstick currency by which other international currencies would subsequently be compared against.</p>
<p>Following this, other countries were required to establish an exchange rate based on the relative exchange rate of the US Dollar to the home currency. Nevertheless, the US dollar could not subdue <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/gold-trading-supply-and-demand-of-gold">gold</a> as it held the highest amount of substantial reserves globally. To this end, they instead attached a higher importance to gold against the dollar exchange rate. The dollar as the standard unit of exchange would lead to the creation of a free-floating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Formation of Free-Floating System</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oppositions to the dollar dominance brought about by the Bretton Woods Accord led to the Smithsonian Agreement in December of 1971. This session allowed for a greater fluctuation band for the currencies. The United States pitched the dollar to gold at the exchange rate of <strong>$38/ounce</strong>, thereby depreciating the dollar. Under the Smithsonian agreement, other major currencies could fluctuate by 2.25% against the US Dollar. The US Dollar has a pair of gold.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>The Plaza Accord</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the early 1980s, the weight of the <a href="https://lptemplatedev.wpengine.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/3-factors-that-affect-us-dollar-rate">US dollar</a> was crumbling the economies of the third-world nations under debt and closing most European factories because they could not compete with other foreign competitors.</p>
<p>Consequently, in 1985 the G-5, the most powerful economies in the world comprising the US, Great Britain, France, West Germany, and Japan, came together and sent representatives to what was known as a secret meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. News of the meeting leaked, forcing the G-5 to make a statement encouraging the appreciation of non-dollar currencies, including the Euro, yen and pounds. This was therefore known as the &#8216;Plaza Accord&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Who controls the Forex market?</h2>
<p>Forex Trading Today</p>
<p>With the advent of the internet, forex trading would immediately spread like wildfire across various countries. The banks played significant roles in standardizing today&#8217;s forex market by providing necessary liquidity to exchange and trade <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/ten-most-traded-currencies">multiple currencies</a>.</p>
<p>Next, to enable the individual to trade in the <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/complete-forex-trading-guide-trading-strategies-for-beginner">forex market</a> without going to the bank to place their orders, the need for digital financial intermediaries linking the individuals to the Forex market arose. This gap is today filled by <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/type-of-brokers">brokers</a>. Today an individual can use the smartphone to create a trading account with any given broker and freely participate in the global foreign exchange market.</p>
