<p style="text-align: center">SBUX – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBUX</a> trades at $97.72, with support at $95.00 and $89.32 on further weakness.</p>
<p>Some consumers have been boycotting the company since October after it sued Workers United, which organizes its employees, due to the union posting a pro-Palestinian message on social media.</p>
<p>Starbucks wanted to halt the union using its name and logo, saying the company had no official stance on the war, but the company has taken criticism on the matter.</p>
<p>Some stores were vandalized, and Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan wrote an open letter against the protests in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I am grateful for so much, I am concerned about the state of the world we live in. There are conflicts in many parts. It has unleashed violence against the innocent, hate and weaponized speech and lies — all of which we condemn,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Our stance is clear. We stand for humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seattle-based Starbucks has yet to say how it has impacted sales. The company&#8217;s subsequent quarterly earnings will come out in February. But there are indications the company is seeing a hit to sales.</p>
<p>In early December, J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe lowered his US sales forecast for Starbucks&#8217; fiscal first quarter, saying holiday sales appeared to be slower than promotions in the fall. Starbucks&#8217; shares dropped on the news while videos on X showed protests and empty stores in London, Australia, Dubai, and others.</p>
<p>Starbucks has since offered more deals than usual to draw customers, like half-price Thursday drinks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reversal of fortune for Starbucks after it reported record sales in its latest quarter and said growth was accelerating in China.</p>
<p>The company has also faced strike issues due to the union, with workers at 370 company-owned stores voting to unionize since late 2021, but the company has not confirmed a contract with them. Workers walked out at several stores in December, and this month, the union is urging consumers not to buy the company&#8217;s gift cards.</p>
<p>SBUX shares could see further pressure into its February report and beyond if there are signs of slowing sales.</p>
