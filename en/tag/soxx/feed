										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><b>SOXX (NYSE:SOXX)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> semiconductor index is testing the uptrend that has been in place since late-2022. That could have a big bearing on the rally in </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the index tracking all of the large chipmakers, such as Nvidia and Qualcomm.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SOXX &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of SOXX has fallen from highs near $260 in July and now trades at $216 after breaking the uptrend line. A correction could form if it cannot hold this as a support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The semiconductor industry has been the driver of modern tech innovation, and global sales have hit a record $55.3 billion in September, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). That is the highest monthly total ever, underscoring the industry’s role in driving advancements from artificial intelligence (AI) to electric vehicles (EVs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AI boom has driven the rally in US stocks as investors looked ahead to continued strong sales in chips, however Nvidia’s latest earnings hint at a slowdown in the growth boom. The AI trend has also struggled to bring big gains for companies outside of data centers and cloud computing storage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next week or two could be important for the overall rally if the current price level fails to find buyers. Global tensions are rising with the Ukraine war and a potential for profit-taking could be a theme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billionaire investor Ken Fisher is still a fan of the AI trend buying up $481.5 million of Nvidia shares and $262.8 million worth of Microsoft in Q3.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33150 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOXX-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="SOXX – Daily Chart" width="903" height="629" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOXX-–-Daily-Chart.webp 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOXX-–-Daily-Chart-300x209.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOXX-–-Daily-Chart-768x535.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SOXX – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of SOXX saw a sharp breakdown, which took out an uptrend support line. The price is now testing $219-220, with the previous highs at $240.</p>
<p>Arm Holdings&#8217; full-year revenue forecast on Wednesday missed investors&#8217; expectations. The company had soared from its September IPO as a chip designer to the largest semiconductor firm. Shares of Arm fell 7% in after-hours trading in the U.S.</p>
<p>The semiconductor sector was booming on AI optimism but slipped last month on growing concerns about the long-term demand outlook for chips and weak demand from China. There were weaker earnings from Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Super Micro Computer, but the market is bidding the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stocks</a> with other tech sectors.</p>
<p>AMD delivered gloomy guidance for 2024 sales of its newly released AI chip, which pushed the stock down 9%. Although the company did raise its revenue target for the MI300 line to at least $4 billion from $3.5 billion. Wall Street was looking for a bigger boost, and around 12 analysts cut their price targets on AMD.</p>
<p>Super Micro Computer plunged 14% following its revenue miss due to concerns over the profitability of a new line of servers. However, some analysts raised the target price on the stock because AI demand is still in the early stages and will continue to grow.</p>
<p>The largest holdings in the SOXX index are Nvidia and Broadcom, which were up 6.27% and 3.7%, respectively, over the last week. Another top holding is Qualcomm, which is up almost 10% over that period.</p>
<p>The outlook for the index is good if those large holdings can keep gaining, but this earnings season has raised some alarm bells about the pace of demand.</p>
