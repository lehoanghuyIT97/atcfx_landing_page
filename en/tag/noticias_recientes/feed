										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US tech firm <strong>Palantir (NAS100:PLTR)</strong> will release its latest <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a> on Monday with stocks near a record high.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48808" style="width: 726px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48808" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PLTR-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="PLTR – Daily Chart" width="726" height="544" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PLTR-–-Daily-Chart.png 726w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PLTR-–-Daily-Chart-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48808" class="wp-caption-text">PLTR – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PLTR shares</a> are set to open on Monday near the all-time highs around $125 and the earnings will determine whether the stock can break out or start a correction. The stock has made a strong recovery from the tariff fallout lows.</p>
<p>Palantir will release its Q1 earnings on Monday after the market closes, and investors will be looking for the company to build on its early AI gains. Companies and governments have been looking to leverage Palantir&#8217;s deep expertise in managing and protecting data as they train and run new AI apps.</p>
<p>The company reported strong activity and demand for its AI platform (AIP).</p>
<p>&#8220;We closed a record-setting number of deals in Q4, including 32 deals worth $10 million or more. Our US business is at the forefront of the AI revolution, growing 52% year-over-year in Q4,&#8221; said Karp on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last year.</p>
<p>Palantir beat analysts’ revenue forecasts by 6.8% last quarter, with revenues of $827.5 million, up 36% year on year. This quarter, analysts are expecting Palantir’s to see revenue growth of 35.9% year on year to $862.3 million.</p>
<p>Earnings releases for Palantir’s peers have already been positive with Commvault Systems delivering year-on-year revenue growth of 23.2%, beating analysts’ expectations by 4.8%, and Confluent reported revenues up 24.8%, beating estimates by 2.6%.</p>
<p>The latest Palantir earnings will be an important marker for the company as they could set up a breakout higher and a new leg of share price improvement. Any disappointment could set up another correction into the recent April lows, but the positive sector performance does not hint at impending weakness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Famed investor Warren Buffett will host the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate and investors will be interested in his views of the economy. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48779" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48779" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48779" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRK-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BRK - Daily Chart" width="823" height="492" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRK-Daily-Chart.png 823w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRK-Daily-Chart-300x179.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRK-Daily-Chart-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48779" class="wp-caption-text">BRK &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BRK shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tumbled with the trade war in April but bounced back to the recent highs near 800,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren Buffett had a strong year in 2024 as he sold two of his favorite stocks, built his cash pile to more than $300 billion, and led Berkshire Hathaway to a $1 trillion market value for the first time ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 94-year-old investor had to say goodbye to his trusted partner, gave $6 billion to good causes, and provided further clarity on his plans to give away his fortune. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key themes on Buffett has been the huge cash pile as the value investor sees little opportunity to load up on his stocks. Investors will be looking for clarity on the recent </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tariff trade wars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to see if the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ made any purchases.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berkshire Hathaway currently has a market capitalization of around $1 trillion, making it the seventh most valuable publicly-traded company in the US, ahead of Tesla. If there is any concern this year it will surround the company’s insurance bets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early estimates on recent fires in Los Angeles suggest that damages may total $1.3 billion. Investors are usually interested in Buffett’s views on Apple stock. In 2016, Berkshire Hathaway invested in a technology stock for the first time but Buffett’s late partner Charlie Munger, said it wasn’t a tech company. He said that Apple was actually a great consumer company, similar to their successful investments in Coca-Cola. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2018, Berkshire had built an Apple stake of more than 1 billion shares. However, from 2024, the company started to reduce its holdings. The gains from those sales are now held in cash and Treasury securities and total around $318 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As thousands descend on Omaha for the annual meeting, they will be keen to hear about tariffs and the path of the US economy.</span></p>
