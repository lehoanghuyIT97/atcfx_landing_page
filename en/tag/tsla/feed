										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of Tesla broke lower and was below support before its Tuesday earnings release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32360" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TSLA-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="TSLA – Weekly Chart" width="1015" height="639" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TSLA-–-Weekly-Chart.png 1015w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TSLA-–-Weekly-Chart-300x189.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TSLA-–-Weekly-Chart-768x483.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">TSLA – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TSLA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trades at $147.05 but has closed below weekly support, which could be ominous for the upcoming earnings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla slashed the price of three of its five models in the US late Friday before making further price cuts globally, including in China and Germany. The company has been facing falling sales, a Cybertruck recall, and growing competition against its electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk&#8217;s company made significant price cuts, including its top seller domestically, the Model Y, and its X and S models. The company also reduced the price of its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; driver assistant software. These price cuts, coupled with the recent recall of the Cybertruck, have created a challenging environment for Tesla, prompting investors to exercise caution and stay informed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think the next few weeks are a &#8216;get out the popcorn moment&#8217; for tech,&#8221; Dan Ives, equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said on Bloomberg TV last week. He added that this will be a &#8220;flex the muscles moment&#8221; for tech companies and a &#8220;golden buying opportunity.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Ives remains optimistic about the EV maker, he emphasises the importance of the issues that Musk needs to address during the earnings call. These include China&#8217;s growth decline, guidance on growth, profit margins, and cash flow. The company&#8217;s plans for its Model 2 and its use of artificial intelligence will also be crucial. This information is vital for investors to understand the potential impact on the company&#8217;s performance.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla were sharply lower after data showed lower sales in China due to the Lunar New Year and competition.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30544 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TSLA–Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="TSLA–Daily-Chart" width="745" height="671" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TSLA–Daily-Chart.jpg 745w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TSLA–Daily-Chart-300x270.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">TSLA – Daily Chart</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla shares</a> dropped 7% on Monday to %188.14 and are pointing to a lower open on Tuesday. Support below the $187 level comes to around $150, with the 2023 lows at $110.</p>
<p>According to data from the China Passenger Car Association, Tesla sold 60,365 vehicles in February, down 19% from a year earlier and the lowest since December 2022.</p>
<p>The Chinese Lunar New Year added a seasonal slump to car purchases, but Tesla is also fighting against domestic competition from BYD and Xpeng.</p>
<p>Tesla, which cut prices on some models in China in January, also unveiled new incentives, including insurance subsidies, in March. However, its competitors are doing the same, with BYD announcing a cheaper version of an updated SUV on Monday, while Xpeng also extended a price cut into the end of March on its G6 model.</p>
<p>The US automakers&#8217; lowest shipment total in over a year concerns the company and its investors, with China seen as a huge growth market. BYD was not immune to the slowdown, with its February sales dropping to 122,311 units from 193,655, down 37%.</p>
<p>According to a report from Deutsche Bank on Monday, Tesla&#8217;s latest incentives on the mainland include the &#8220;equivalent of ~$4.8K price cut to customers who purchase from existing inventories of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by the end of March. &#8220;BYD has also said it does not plan to bring its vehicles to the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not planning to come to the US,&#8221; Stella Li, CEO of BYD Americas, told Yahoo Finance Live. &#8220;It&#8217;s an interesting market, but it is very complicated,&#8221; she added, noting political pushback on Chinese companies and the slowing rate of EV adoption.</p>
