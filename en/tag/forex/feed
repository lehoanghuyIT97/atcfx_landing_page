										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Forex Trading</h2>
<p>Forex trading, also known as <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign exchange</a> trading or currency trading, is the global marketplace for exchanging national currencies against one another. As one of the largest financial markets in the world, it operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, and boasts a daily trading volume that exceeds $6 trillion. This market is essential for international trade, investments, and global economic stability.</p>
<h2>Forex Currency Pairs and Quotes</h2>
<p>In Forex trading, currencies are quoted in pairs, and each pair is associated with a two-part price: the bid and the ask. The bid price represents the maximum amount a buyer is willing to pay for a currency, while the ask price represents the minimum amount a seller is willing to accept. Currency pairs are categorised into three types:</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40985 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/types-of-forex-currency-pairs-major-minor-exotic-pairs-1.webp" alt="types-of-forex-currency-pairs-major-minor-exotic-pairs" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/types-of-forex-currency-pairs-major-minor-exotic-pairs-1.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/types-of-forex-currency-pairs-major-minor-exotic-pairs-1-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/types-of-forex-currency-pairs-major-minor-exotic-pairs-1-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/types-of-forex-currency-pairs-major-minor-exotic-pairs-1-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Major Pairs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/ten-most-traded-currencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Major pairs</a> involve the most traded currencies globally, such as EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD. Major pairs typically offer high liquidity and tight spreads.</p>
<h3>Minor Pairs</h3>
<p>Minor pairs consist of currencies from major economies but do not involve the US dollar. Examples include EUR/GBP, AUD/JPY, and CAD/CHF. Minor pairs often have wider spreads compared to major pairs.</p>
<h3>Exotic Pairs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/most-traded-exotic-currency-pairs-in-forex-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exotic pairs</a> involve one major currency and one currency from a smaller or emerging market, such as USD/ZAR (US Dollar/South African rand), USD/CNH (US Dollar/Chinese Renminbi Offshore) or EUR/HUF (Euro/Hungarian Forint). Exotic pairs tend to be less liquid and more volatile.</p>
<h2>Understanding Forex Trading Base and Quote Currency</h2>
<p>Forex trading involves buying one currency while simultaneously selling another. These transactions occur in currency pairs, such as <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-eurusd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EUR/USD</a>, GBP/USD or GBP/JPY, where the first currency listed is the base currency and the second is the quote currency. The goal of forex trading is to profit from the fluctuations in exchange rates between these two currencies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40986 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/forex-trading-base-and-quote-currency.webp" alt="" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/forex-trading-base-and-quote-currency.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/forex-trading-base-and-quote-currency-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/forex-trading-base-and-quote-currency-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/forex-trading-base-and-quote-currency-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if a trader believes the euro will strengthen against the US dollar, they might buy the EUR/USD pair, hoping to sell it later at a higher price. Conversely, if they expect the euro to weaken, they would sell the pair, aiming to repurchase it at a lower price.</p>
<h2>What Are Pips in Forex Trading?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-pip-in-forex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pip</a>, which stands for &#8220;percentage in point,&#8221; is the smallest price movement that can occur in a currency pair within the Forex market. Typically, for most currency pairs, one pip equals 0.0001. For example, if the EUR/USD pair moves from 1.1050 to 1.1051, it has increased by one pip. Pips are fundamental in Forex trading as they help calculate both profits and losses, representing the incremental changes in exchange rates that traders aim to capitalise on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40987 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pips-in-forex-trading.webp" alt="pips-in-forex-trading" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pips-in-forex-trading.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pips-in-forex-trading-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pips-in-forex-trading-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pips-in-forex-trading-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>What Is the Spread in Forex Trading?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-spread-in-forex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spread</a> in forex trading refers to the difference between the bid (selling) price and the ask (buying) price of a currency pair. The spread is essentially the cost of executing a trade and is a primary way brokers earn money. For instance, if the EUR/USD bid price is 1.1050 and the ask price is 1.1100, the spread is 50 pips. In markets with high liquidity, such as major currency pairs, spreads are typically narrower, while less liquid markets, like exotic currency pairs, often have wider spreads.</p>

<h2>What Is Lot Size in Forex Trading?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-lot-size-in-forex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lot size</a> in Forex trading determines the volume or amount of currency involved in a trade. It is a crucial factor in calculating a trade&#8217;s potential profit or loss. Different lot sizes include:</p>
<table style="width: 61.0559%;">

<td style="width: 23.4206%;">Lot Size</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Standard Lot</h3>
<p>Standard lot is equivalent to 100,000 units of the base currency. For example, one standard lot in the EUR/USD pair involves trading 100,000 euros.</p>
<h3>Mini Lot</h3>
<p>Mini lot is equal to 10,000 units of the base currency, which is one-tenth of a standard lot. This size is commonly used by traders with smaller accounts.</p>
<h3>Micro Lot</h3>
<p>Micro lot consists of 1,000 units of the base currency, one-tenth of a mini lot, often used by beginners or those minimising risk.</p>
<h3>Nano Lot</h3>
<p>Nano Lot comprises 100 units of the base currency and is ideal for extremely cautious traders who prefer minimal trade amounts.</p>
<p>Understanding lot size is vital for effective risk management in Forex trading, as it directly influences the financial impact of each pip movement.</p>
<h2>The Structure of the Forex Market</h2>
<p>The forex market is unique in its decentralised nature. Unlike stock markets, which are typically centralised on a single exchange, forex trading occurs over-the-counter (OTC). This means that transactions are conducted directly between parties, usually through electronic trading platforms or via telephone, without a centralised exchange.</p>
<p>The forex market is composed of several key players:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40989 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/structure-of-the-forex-market-players.webp" alt="structure-of-the-forex-market-players" width="1200" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/structure-of-the-forex-market-players.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/structure-of-the-forex-market-players-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/structure-of-the-forex-market-players-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/structure-of-the-forex-market-players-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Banks</strong>: Central banks play a pivotal role in the forex market by managing currency reserves, setting interest rates, and intervening in the market to stabilise their currency.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Banks</strong>: These institutions conduct large volumes of currency transactions for clients and for their trading accounts. They also provide liquidity to the market.</li>
<li><strong>Hedge Funds and Investment Managers</strong>: These entities trade significant amounts of currency to hedge against risk or for speculative purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Corporations</strong>: Multinational companies engage in forex trading to facilitate international trade, such as converting revenue from overseas sales.</li>
<li><strong>Retail Traders</strong>: With the advent of online trading platforms, individual traders now have access to the forex market. Although retail traders account for a smaller portion of the overall market, their influence has grown significantly in recent years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Do Forex Market Hours Affect Trading?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/why-forex-markets-open-24-hours-a-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forex market operates 24 hours a day</a>, five days a week, due to its global nature. This continuous operation is possible because as financial centres in different parts of the world open and close, the market remains active, with trading sessions in Asia, Europe, and North America. This 24/5 structure allows traders to react promptly to global events and economic developments, regardless of their location, ensuring that trading opportunities are available almost around the clock.</p>
<h2>Factors Influencing Forex Prices</h2>
<p>Currency prices in the forex market are influenced by various factors, which traders must consider when making decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>: Central banks&#8217; interest rate policies significantly drive currency prices. Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment, leading to an appreciation of the currency.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Indicators</strong>: Economic data such as GDP growth, employment figures, and inflation rates can impact currency values. Positive economic news typically strengthens a currency, while negative data can weaken it.</li>
<li><strong>Political Stability</strong>: A country’s political environment can influence its currency. Stable governments tend to attract investment, while political uncertainty or unrest can lead to currency depreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Market Sentiment</strong>: Traders&#8217; perceptions and expectations can also drive currency prices. If investors believe a currency will strengthen, they may buy it, increasing its value.</li>
<li><strong>Global Events</strong>: Events such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or pandemics can have immediate and often unpredictable effects on currency prices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Forex Trading Works</h2>
<p>Forex trading can be conducted through various methods, depending on the trader&#8217;s goals and risk tolerance. Following are the types of forex trades.</p>
<h3>Spot Market</h3>
<p>The spot market is where currencies are bought and sold for immediate delivery. Prices are determined by supply and demand in real-time, and trades are usually settled within two business days. The spot market is the most common form of forex trading.</p>
<h3>Forward Market</h3>
<p>In the forward market, traders enter into contracts to buy or sell a currency at a future date, at a predetermined price. This method is often used by companies and financial institutions to hedge against currency risk.</p>
<h3>Futures Market</h3>
<p>Similar to the forward market, the futures market involves contracts to buy or sell currency at a future date. However, unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are standardised and traded on exchanges. Futures trading is often used by speculators looking to profit from anticipated currency movements.</p>
<h3>Options Market</h3>
<p>The options market allows traders to buy or sell a currency at a specific price before a certain date, but they are not obligated to do so. This gives traders the flexibility to hedge against potential losses while limiting their risk.</p>
<h3>Second Contract (Contracts for Difference)</h3>
<p>Second Contract are derivative products that allow traders to speculate on currency price movements without owning the underlying asset. Second Contract trading can offer high leverage, meaning traders can control a large position with a relatively small investment, but it also comes with higher risk.</p>

<h2>What Is Leverage in Forex Trading?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-leverage-in-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leverage</a> is a key feature of forex trading, allowing traders to control larger positions than they would with their capital alone. For example, with a leverage ratio of 50:1, a trader can control a $50,000 position with just $1,000 of their capital. While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases the risk of significant losses.</p>
<h2>What Is Margin in Forex Trading?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-margin-in-forex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margin</a> is the amount of money required to open and maintain a leveraged position. It is essentially a good-faith deposit that the broker holds to cover potential losses. If a trader&#8217;s position moves against them, they may receive a margin call, requiring them to deposit additional funds to maintain their position.</p>
<h2>How to Manage Risk in Forex Trading?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risk management</a> is a crucial aspect of forex trading and successful traders employ various strategies to protect their capital and limit losses through the following steps.</p>
<h3>Stop-Loss Orders</h3>
<p>A stop-loss order automatically closes a trade when the price reaches a predetermined level. This helps traders minimise losses if the market moves against them.</p>
<h3>Take-Profit Orders</h3>
<p>Stop-loss orders are take-profit orders that automatically close a trade when the price reaches a specific profit target. This allows traders to lock in gains and avoid the temptation of holding onto a position for too long.</p>
<h3>Position Sizing</h3>
<p>Traders carefully consider the size of their positions relative to their overall capital. By risking only a small percentage of their account on each trade, they can minimise the impact of any single loss.</p>
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>Diversification can reduce risk in forex trading. By trading multiple currency pairs, traders can spread their risk across different markets and reduce their exposure to any one currency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>What is EUR/USD</strong></h2>
<p>EURUSD is the exchange rate value of one euro to US dollars. It indicates how many US dollars (USD) are needed to purchase one euro (EUR). For example, if the EUR/USD rate is 1.50, it means that 1 euro can be exchanged for 1.50 US dollars.</p>
<p>EURUSD pair is the most traded currency pair globally, making up a major portion of the forex market. EURUSD has more liquidity, tighter spreads, and greater market depth compared to GBP/USD and USD/JPY.</p>
<h2><strong>Examples of the EUR/USD Exchange Rate</strong></h2>
<p>For example, if a European company sells goods worth €10,000 to a US company, and the EUR/USD rate is 1.20, the US company will need to pay $12,000 (10,000 x 1.20) for the goods.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the rate drops to 1.10, the same goods would cost the US company $11,000. This demonstrates the direct impact of exchange rates on international trade.</p>
<h2><strong>Why is the EUR/USD Structured with the Euro as the Base Currency?</strong></h2>
<p>EUR/USD currency pairs use euro as the base currency, and the US dollar is the quoted currency. This structure is somewhat unique because, in most currency pairs, the US dollar typically serves as the base currency. The EURUSD shows the euro&#8217;s important role in the global economy, highlighting the Eurozone&#8217;s economic power.</p>
<h2><strong>The Differences Between EUR/USD and USD/EUR</strong></h2>
<p>EUR/USD shows the dollars needed to buy one euro, while USD/EUR shows the euros needed to buy one dollar. For example, if EUR/USD is 1.20, then USD/EUR is 0.8333 (1/1.20).</p>
<p>This inverse relationship impacts traders’ strategies and economic interpretations, highlighting the need to understand which currency is the base and which is the quote.</p>

<h2><strong>Major Factors that Impact the Euro to Dollar Exchange Rate</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Interest rate differences set by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) can drive demand for euros or dollars.</li>
<li>Economic indicators like GDP growth, employment rates, and inflation figures from the Eurozone and the US can significantly impact the exchange rate.</li>
<li>Geopolitical events like political stability, trade agreements, and international conflicts can change market perceptions and currency values.</li>
<li>Economic events like changes in monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, and crises can significantly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Role of International Trade Between Europe and the USA</strong></h3>
<p>A trade surplus in the Eurozone means higher demand for euros, potentially strengthening the EUR/USD rate. Conversely, a trade deficit could weaken the euro against the dollar.</p>
<h2><strong>History of the Euro to Dollar</strong></h2>
<p>EUR/USD currency pair has changed significantly since the euro was introduced on 1 January 1999. Initially, the euro was valued lower than the dollar, but it gained strength, peaking at around 1.60 in 2008.</p>
<p>These changes reflect the economic conditions and monetary policies of the Eurozone and the US. Historical analysis shows that the EUR/USD exchange rate follows patterns influenced by macroeconomic trends, such as shifts in economic growth and policy differences between the ECB and the Fed.</p>
<p>The relationship between the euro and the dollar has evolved through various economic cycles, including the 2008 global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, and uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each event has left a distinct mark on the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/eur-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EUR/USD exchange rate live chart</a>, as shown on the live chart.</p>
<h3>Milestones:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1999:</strong> Introduction of the euro, initially valued lower than the dollar.</li>
<li><strong>2008:</strong> Euro peaks at around 1.60 USD.</li>

<h2><strong>Why is the EUR/USD Pair Considered the Most Traded Currency Pair?</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">GBPUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The BoE kept its key interest rate unchanged at 5% due to ongoing concerns about inflation within the bank&#8217;s monetary policy committee. The important services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy, has seen elevated prices. Figures on Wednesday showed that inflation overall in the UK remained at an annual rate of 2.2% in August, still above the bank&#8217;s goal.</p>
<p>Minutes of the bank&#8217;s latest meeting showed that eight out of the nine members of the panel voted to keep rates unchanged, while only one backed a quarter-point reduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economy has been evolving broadly as we expected. If that continues, we should be able to reduce rates gradually over time,&#8221; said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. &#8220;But it&#8217;s vital that inflation stays low, so we need to be careful not to cut too fast or by too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BoE is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, which follows the new government&#8217;s budget on October 30. The Labour government has said that it needs to plug a £22 billion pound ($29 billion) hole in the public finances and has indicated that it may need to raise taxes and lower spending. That could weigh on the near-term outlook for the British economy and put downward pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>The deputy chief economist at Aberdeen, Luke Bartholomew, said the Bank of England &#8220;will need to incorporate any fiscal changes in its next forecasts, which could provide the foundation for more rapid cuts in due course.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPNZD – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPNZD has found resistance at the 2.159 level after another attempt at the summer 2023 highs. If economic data supports the NZD, the price may retreat toward support at 2.060. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand’s central bank will have a strict policy decision this week, with economists and investors unclear whether they will start cutting interest rates or wait for further signs of cooling inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bloomberg survey said 12 21 economists expect the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to keep the benchmark cash rate at 5.5% tomorrow. Nine economists said they would start an easing cycle. According to bond market data, traders now see a 70% chance of a rate cut.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The risk of tight monetary policy overshooting has gotten real,” said Nick Tuffley at ASB Bank in Auckland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think the time for the RBNZ to cut is now, but a lot depends on how much its forecasts have shifted”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Zealand economy has shown signs of entering a third recession in two years, and inflation has slowed down more than the central bank expected. All eyes will be on the RBNZ press conference at 11 a.m. HKT. The bank said a few months ago that it would start cutting rates in a year but is now looking at moving more quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is difficult to justify such a radical change in the RBNZ’s thinking based on the evolution of data in recent months,” said Sharon Zollner, chief NZ economist at ANZ Bank. Analysts there see the bank making its first cut to come in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waiting for more evidence of the state of play is justified and relatively low cost, given monetary conditions have already eased substantially”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBNZ will be followed by essential data for the UK economy, where inflation is expected to increase from 2% to 2.3%. The Bank of England cut interest rates at their last meeting, and it may need to pause if inflation moves higher again.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">USDCAD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>If Monday&#8217;s Canadian dollar strength continues, the USD vs CAD rate will have support below 1.3615.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, data will be released with the Canadian inflation rate at 8:30 pm HKT. The market is expecting a dip to the 2.6% level versus 2.7% last month. That will be followed two hours later by US consumer confidence. Traders will also see US <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/financial-events/gross-domestic-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDP</a> growth figures on Wednesday and PCE <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/inflation-causes-effects-implications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation</a> figures on Thursday.</p>
<p>Weaker treasury yields have been influencing the price of the US dollar on Monday. Fed officials have signalled that there will be only one rate cut this year, but investors are looking for data or events to speed up that descent.</p>
<p>Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said on Monday that there is enough slack in the Canadian labour market to see growth and create more jobs even as inflation declines.</p>
<p>The central bank joined the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/financial-events/european-central-bank-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECB</a> this month by cutting its policy rate for the first time in more than four years and said more cuts were likely if inflation continued to show it was on a firm path back to the 2% target.</p>
<p>&#8220;With some slack in the economy, there is room for the Canadian economy to grow and add more jobs even as inflation continues to move closer to the target,&#8221; Macklem said.</p>
<p>He added that officials do not think a significant rise in the jobless rate was needed to hit the 2% inflation target.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has always been a narrow path and we have yet to fully stick the landing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Job search difficulty suggests the government has some room to slow the growth of non-permanent residents without tightening the labor market too much and causing significant labor shortages&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell welcomed an inflation drop in May but said policymakers were still seeking consistent signs that the economy was cooling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see today&#8217;s report as progress and building confidence, but we don&#8217;t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant beginning to loosen policy at this time,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Central Bank announces its latest interest rate decision tonight, and the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURCAD</a> has hit some price resistance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30564 aligncenter" src="https://.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EURCAD–Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="EURCAD–Daily-Chart" width="796" height="598" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EURCAD–Daily-Chart.jpg 796w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EURCAD–Daily-Chart-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EURCAD–Daily-Chart-768x577.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">EURCAD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>EURCAD has been climbing since February as investors look to capitalize on the potential for a eurozone economic recovery. The 1.4764 level was resistance in December and has capped the price ahead of the data. That will determine a continuation or correction.</p>
<p>The ECB decision comes at 9:15 pm HKT, but traders can see the reaction to the data and capitalize on a higher breakout or a lower breakdown. Canadian trade emerged after that decision and just before the critical ECB press conference.</p>
<p>Canada&#8217;s trade figures are expected to show a C$0.1BN month after a disappointing deficit last month of C$-0.31BN.</p>
<p>The big event will be the ECB&#8217;s press conference, and President Christine Lagarde can update markets on their idea of a summer rate cut from the central bank. The euro economy has shown some signs of improvement, and that has boosted the euro.</p>
<p>The ECB may also be asked about its largest loss in two decades, which was announced recently.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank posted another large financial loss in 2023, burning through the last of its provisions. It said more losses are forthcoming, with higher rates pushing up interest payments to banks.</p>
<p>While the bank said it can operate &#8220;regardless of any losses,&#8221; the accounts have broader implications for its reputation and independence from state money.</p>
<p>The ECB printed trillions of euros over the last decade despite warnings from conservative economists. The losses could amplify those critics and get louder if central banks ask for additional capital from their governments, which could be seen as a public bailout.</p>
<p>The ECB meeting comes this week after the Bank of Canada kept its benchmark interest rate on hold at 5%. The BoC hiked rates by 475 basis points to a 22-year high between March 2022 and July 2023 but has held them there as it attempts to cool inflation while avoiding pushing the country into a recession.</p>
<p>The euro could show volatility if the ECB President adjusts the markets&#8217; expectation of a June rate cut. A &#8220;higher for longer&#8221; quote would send the euro reeling from the resistance level.</p>

<p><span id="more-24112"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/GBPUSD-Weekly-Chart-British-GDP.webp" alt="GBPUSD-Weekly-Chart-British-GDP" width="685" height="577" loading="lazy" style="height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 685px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto">GBPUSD – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The GBPUSD exchange rate has found support at the 1.2680 level and attempted a rally to 1.2800. A stronger<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/financial-events/gross-domestic-product" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">GDP</a><span>&nbsp;</span>number could see the pair rocket above that mark.</p>
<p>The monthly figure for the UK’s growth engine is expected to flatline at 0%. That would lead to a 0.5% year-on-year figure which still beats the previous recession expectations.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) said in its latest forecast that the UK economy would avoid a recession in 2023. However, a “60% risk” of a recession is still at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The group predicted that UK GDP would increase by 0.4% in 2023, representing a marginal improvement from its previous May forecast. However, Niesr also downgraded earlier predictions of 0.6% growth next year down to 0.3% after pressure from higher-than-expected borrowing costs. The think tank has predicted it will be another year until the country’s growth recovers to its pre-pandemic levels in early 2020.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates, which are expected to peak at 5.5%, will be the crucial headwind for growth prospects.</p>
<p>Stephen Millard, deputy director for macroeconomic modelling and forecasting at Niesr, said: “The triple supply shocks of Brexit, Covid, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, together with the monetary tightening that has been necessary to bring inflation down, have badly affected the UK economy”.</p>
<p>“As a result, we expect stuttering growth over the next two years and GDP to only recover to its 2019 Q4 level in 2024 Q3”.</p>
<p>“The need to address the UK’s poor growth performance remains the key challenge facing policymakers as we approach the next election.”</p>
<p>Tomorrow will also see consumer sentiment figures from the US, which is expected to dip from 71.6 to 71.0 as consumers still wear the scars of the inflation surge. Inflation on Thursday climbed 0.2% but is only 1.2% from the Fed’s target rate.</p>

<p>EURGBP found support at the 0.8550 level but needs to see a catalyst for further gains to test the resistance near 0.8700.</p>
<p>The German<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/financial-events/gross-domestic-product" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">GDP</a><span>&nbsp;</span>figures will be released tomorrow, which are expected to come in at 6.2% after last month&#8217;s 6.4%.</p>

The forecast for the monthly is a flat zero percent, while the year-on-year forecast is for an 0.5% gain.</p>
<p><a href="/en/analysis/financial-events/bank-of-england-interest-rate-meeting" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">Bank of England</a><span>&nbsp;</span>governor Andrew Bailey raised the UK&#8217;s interest rate again but was quiet on the path ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to judge what the path of rates will be. Not least because, as the report indicates, more than one path may deliver inflation back to target sustainably,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had some unpleasant surprises in June, we&#8217;ve seen some of that turnaround, which is frankly, you can put into context today, why I don&#8217;t think, speaking personally, I don&#8217;t think there was a case for a 50 basis point raise today,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that we can deliver the path that we&#8217;ve set out in the report, because the path we&#8217;ve set out in the report does not have a recession in it. We will have to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EURGBP has found some support at current levels, and the uncertainty over UK rates has held it back. If it becomes clear that the Bank of England has halted its rate hikes, then the exchange rate could advance.</p>
<p>Commerzbank CFO Bettina Orlopp said the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/financial-events/european-central-bank-meeting" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">ECB</a><span>&nbsp;</span>is likely finished with its rate increases. &#8220;We will stick to the 3.75% we currently have,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The ECB raised its interest rates in July, completing a full year of increases. ECB President Christine Lagarde said the central bank could continue or pause rate hikes at its next meeting in September but definitely will not cut.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><a href="/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forex trading</a> is a global industry that allows traders worldwide, irrespective of geographic location, to buy and sell different countries&#8217; currencies and profit from their price fluctuations.</p>
<p><span id="more-11077"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What is traded in forex?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">With the high demand for forex and investors&#8217; quest for diversification of portfolios, brokers today have been meticulous in responding to these demands. Hence, we do not just trade foreign currencies alone in forex; more financial tools have been added. Below is the list of the financial instruments traded in forex today:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="line-height: 1.75;"><strong>Currencies</strong>: There are three major groups of currencies traded in forex today.
