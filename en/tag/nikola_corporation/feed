										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NKLA share price was fast approaching the kind of mania seen in electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA) going into the summer of 2020. The NKLA share price rose from under $10 before the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March to over $90 by June. This was off the back of the hydrogen fuelled vehicle maker becoming in vogue with investors. They sought plays which would be tuned into the need for a less polluting environment in the wake of the arrival of the respiratory disease centred virus<span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">.</span></p>

<h2>Clean energy boom for NKLA Shares</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Initially, in 2020 NKLA shares proved to be one of the most high profile proxies to clean energy revival, one which was accompanied by an electric vehicle (EV) and SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) boom. Credibility was further added to NKLA shares by a subsequent deal made with General Motors (GM), with the rally the shares enjoyed briefly causing the market capitalisation to rise to greater than that of Ford (F). </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The fundamental logic was that a maker of zero-emission heavy trucks had caught the zeitgeist, in the sense that in terms of the cost of these environmentally friendly vehicles was pitched correctly for the fleet market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Nikola share price: the deal with GM<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">In terms of the deal with GM, it had obvious attractions, with a nominal value of $2bn for a 11% stake in Nikola. The negative side though was perceived as GM’s intervention being a development deal, one which would provide technological know-how which Nikola would purchase. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Unfortunately, by early September sentiment towards the Nikola Corporation share price was undermined by a short seller report suggesting that Nikola had misrepresented its technology and the likelihood of developing hydrogen powered trucks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nikola’s founder resigns</h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">The resignation of NKLA’s founder and Chairman Trevor Milton only further hurt sentiment and the NKLA share price later in September. In fact, despite the negative publicity which impacted the NKLA share price, bears of the company may have missed or exaggerated various points. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">For instance, GM stood by its due diligence on Nikola, with its former GM Vice Chairman having been the lead on the SPAC which took NKLA shares public. It is also the case that events at Nikola in terms of the recent newsflow are very much in accordance with companies at the pre-revenue stage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>NKLA Shares Q3 Update</h2>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">The latest Q3 update from Nikola has shed light on where the company currently stands. It underlines the way that the commitment to assemble “the first Nikola Tre BEV prototypes” continues. Also key in terms of corporate governance, Steve Girsky was appointed Chairman of the Board in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">To allay fiscal doubts Nikola said that it ended the quarter with a strong cash position of $908m, net of $15m in restricted cash. Milestones for Q4 include new collaboration partners and the rollout of hydrogen fueling infrastructure.</span></p>

<h2>Nikola Corporation Share Price Daily Chart</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The key question as far as NKLA shares is whether the retreat from the highs of the year through $90 has run its course? If this is the case then close to $18 we may be looking at a recovery situation. September’s $16 floor remains in focus as this was the low for NKLA shares in the aftermath of the short seller intervention. The assumption to make is that the longer $16 support is held, the greater the chance of an eventual recovery for NKLA shares.</span></p>
