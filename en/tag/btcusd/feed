<p style="text-align: center;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>BTC slipped to $82,500 ahead of Tuesday’s session and could look to retest the $78250 support. The post-election rally starred at $67,668 and that can be the next target.</p>
<p>BlackRock management believes that he U.S. dollar could lose its status as the world’s reserve currency to Bitcoin or other digital assets if the United States does not get its debt under control.</p>
<p>Chairman Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter to Investors that “decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation” that makes “markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent”. But “that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar”.</p>
<p>The U.S. debt equaled 122.3% of the country’s gross domestic product in 2023, which was higher than the 105% seen in 2018.</p>
<p>If every asset ends up being tokenized, Fink said, “it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth”.</p>
<p>That forward-looking assessment is not helping the price of BTC in the short-term as the price has struggled in 2025.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s strategic reserve has disappointed investors as it will only hold BTC that was recovered by Federal investigators. Coins such as Solana and XRP may fare better with outright purchases later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s tariffs</a> were set to come into effect on Wednesday 2 April but they have already rocked markets and it remains to be seen if the global economy will suffer in coming months. A reduction in economic activity could weaken the appetite for tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> is back above the $60,000 level as stock market strength boosts the world&#8217;s largest digital currency.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40926 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="BTCUSD – Daily Chart" width="853" height="573" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.webp 853w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x202.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x516.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price of BTC</a> trades at $63,473 and has resistance just above $65,000. The larger target to the upside would be just ahead of the $70,000 level.</p>
<p>Digital asset investment products saw a second straight week of inflows, with a net of $321 million, according to crypto asset manager CoinShares.</p>
<p>CoinShares said the 50 basis-point interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve has added to positive sentiment about holding non-yielding assets.</p>
<p>Bitcoin-linked products were at the forefront of inflows with $284 million, while <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/ethereum-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> saw outflows of $29 million. This was the fifth consecutive week that ETH products had registered outflows, even as the second-largest cryptocurrency led gainers after the Fed move.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is due to persistent outflows from the incumbent Grayscale Trust and scant inflows from the newly issued ETFs,&#8221; CoinShares wrote.</p>
<p>Ethereum exchange-traded funds have consistently underperformed bitcoin ETFs since they were listed in the US in July. Their first five weeks of trading saw $500 million outflows, while their BTC counterparts experienced more than $5 billion of inflows during their first five weeks.</p>
<p>JPMorgan said bitcoin&#8217;s &#8220;first mover advantage,&#8221; the lack of staking provision in ETH products and lower liquidity, made them less appealing to institutional investors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BTC was also boosted by news that BlackRock&#8217;s ETF on the coin has been approved for options trading by the US regulator. There is a belief that (NYSE:IBIT) options will further help draw institutions to the crypto market.</p>
<p>Jeff Park, portfolio manager at Bitwise Asset Management, said IBIT options could also create a gamma squeeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin options have negative vanna: as spot goes up, so does volatility, meaning delta increases even faster. When dealers [market makers] who are short gamma hedge this (gamma squeeze), bitcoin&#8217;s case becomes explosively recursive. More upside leads to even more upside as dealers are forced to keep buying at higher prices. A negative vanna gamma squeeze acts like a refueling rocket,&#8221; Park said on X.</p>
<p>&#8220;With bitcoin options, investors can now make duration-based portfolio allocation bets, especially for long-term horizons. There&#8217;s a good chance that owning long-dated OTM calls as premium spend will give investors more bang for their buck than a fully-collateralized position that could drop by 80% over the same period,&#8221; Park said.</p>
<p>Bitcoin should remain supported as stocks move higher, and investors should keep an eye on developments in the options market for the digital currency.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of BTC has tumbled through the $60,000 level, and the next support is at the $56,577 level.</p>
<p>Investors selling on Monday were fearing up to 140,000 bitcoins hitting the market in less than one month. That number of coins would be like the liquidation of Fidelity&#8217;s spot <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/bitcoin-spot-etfs-finally-approved-by-us-regulators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin ETF</a>, which recently held more than 160,000 bitcoins.</p>
<p>However, some analysts did not expect to see that many coins sold.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think fewer coins will be distributed than people think and that it will cause less bitcoin sell pressure than the market expects,&#8221; said Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital.</p>
<p>Thorn told CoinDesk that 75% of creditors will take the &#8220;early&#8221; payout in July, meaning a distribution of about 95,000 coins. He also said 65,000 of those coins will go to individual investors, but they may be more keen to hold onto them.</p>
<p>Recent <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETF</a> outflows showed that a second consecutive week of selling was the highest two weeks of outflows since the ETFs were founded in January. The next few weeks could be tough for Bitcoin if Mt. Gox&#8217;s selling leads to further investor capitulation.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Bitcoin whale transactions (exceeding $100,000) were lower by 42% from the previous days ahead of the Mt. Gox news, according to data from Santiment.</p>
<p>Mt. Gox was launched in Shibuya, Japan, in 2010 and, at one point, handled more than 70% of all bitcoin trades. However, it ceased operations in 2014 after hundreds of thousands of coins went missing.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is still up 40% year-to-date based on current prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of Bitcoin crashed by $10,000 after testing the all-time high once again.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30554 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BTCUSD–Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="BTCUSD–Daily-Chart" width="793" height="577" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BTCUSD–Daily-Chart.jpg 793w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BTCUSD–Daily-Chart-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BTCUSD–Daily-Chart-768x559.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> traded near the $69,250 level and was smacked down to $57,750. That highlights the speculative aspect and thin market. The move from $51,000 has been a blowoff, and traders should be cautious on the long side.</p>
<p>&#8220;The demand for these <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETFs</a> far exceeded anyone&#8217;s expectations,&#8221; Bitwise Asset Management CEO Matt Hougan said. The company was among those that launched a BTC ETF after SEC approval, which has sparked an investment frenzy. Some money managers are now predicting the digital token could rise above $100,000 before the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Investors are also bidding up the broader market, with <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/ethereum-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> outperforming BTC by 7% since the year began. The new funds for trading BTC on share markets were launched in January and have seen inflows of around $8 billion. The funds are physically backed and, therefore, need to buy more coins as the price rises.</p>
<p>According to analysts last week, the new ETFs have been buying up a daily average of 3,320-4,300 coins since the beginning of February. That is a huge amount compared to the 900 coins per day being mined. More supply problems are expected for bitcoin this year, with the following &#8220;halving&#8221; scheduled to take place in around 50 days.</p>
<p>That event is when the reward for mining a new coin is cut in half, another measure that will slow supply in years to come.</p>
<p>However, the liquidity in the market was shown to be weak after the token was slammed lower by around $10-12k in the day&#8217;s trading session. That indicates that there is a lack of buy orders below, and many traders will have been liquidated on longs in the spot market.</p>
