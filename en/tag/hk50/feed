										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese economy has consumer and producer price inflation released today as </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/hk-share-cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look for support.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47872" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="HK 50 – Daily Chart" width="848" height="579" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart.png 848w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart-300x205.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HK-50-–-Daily-Chart-768x524.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">HK 50 – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HK 50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has found support at the 2024 highs but the rally has been less than the move in the US markets. That is likely due to a continued focus on Chinese imports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest consumer and producer prices will be released at 9:30am HKT in China. Consumer prices are expected to show a small 0.1% gain. Producer prices are expected to fall -2.3%. Those are likely to fall further as tariffs impact the demand for Chinese products in the short-term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong stocks had registered their worst fall in 28 years before finding buyers. Shares in Japan, South Korea, and Australia have jumped in early trading with the Nikkei 225 and Kospi indexes gaining more than 5%. Australia’s benchmark saw a 3% rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump’s tariff plans took a sharp turn as he eased up on global nations and focused on China. Trump’s threat to all nations appears to be a bargaining move, and it also looks like he is happy to destroy the global order to ensure that China comes to the negotiating table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He removed &#8220;reciprocal tariffs&#8221; from America’s trading partners and applied 10% tariffs across the board. Mexico and Canada were both exempt and will revert to their original tariff plan. However, he upped tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% after China had announced 84% tariffs on US imports, vowing not to back down in the trade war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hours before Trump&#8217;s announcement, the EU had also voted to impose tariffs on the United States, but were not subject to larger tariffs than the 10%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian markets are expected to rebound on the latest developments but may not see strong buying until China and the US can settle their differences on trade relations.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hang Seng <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a> trades near a key level and will look to Monday’s services PMI from China.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-44520 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HK50-–-Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="HK50 – Daily Chart" width="864" height="597" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HK50-–-Daily-Chart.jpg 864w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HK50-–-Daily-Chart-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HK50-–-Daily-Chart-768x531.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">HK50 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of the Hang Seng bounced from resistance at the psychological 20,000 level, and in the week ahead, it will be important to see if the index can clear that level. The next target on the upside lies at 22,719.</p>
<p>The Caixin services PMI index will be released at 9:45 am HKT on Monday, and traders are looking for a move from 51.4 to 51.7. A stronger number could boost shares in Asia and globally.</p>
<p>Later in the day, markets will focus on the planned certification of Donald Trump’s election win. The January 6 ritual will then move to a January 10 sentencing for the incoming President after his previous conviction for a hush money trial. The judge has said jail time will not be recommended, but there may be a curve ball for markets in the days ahead. The dollar would also be in the crosshairs as the events unfold this week.</p>
<p>European data at 4:55 pm-5 pm HKT could also move the USD with German and Eurozone PMI data.</p>
<p>On the Hong Kong exchange, a rush of companies announced plans to list shares in the country by the end of January. The move boosts the country’s IPO outlook, with six firms saying they intend to hold offerings by late January, seeking to raise HK$3.3 billion. Those include Chinese toy maker Bloks Group Ltd, where retail traders have sought to borrow $60 billion to participate in the offering.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, we can see continued support from the Chinese government to boost the economy, and some early data could help push the indices higher in the short term, starting with Monday’s services PMI figures.</p>
