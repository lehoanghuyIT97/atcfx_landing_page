										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AUDJPY exchange rate will look to recent data for support after the Japanese yen posted further gains. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46380" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDJPY – Daily Chart" width="727" height="586" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 727w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x242.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has bounced near the 93.86 support level which goes back to mid-2024. The coming data will have to bring further buyers to hold that level after BOJ rate hike talk has boosted the yen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aussie dollar got a boost from the latest Reserve Bank meeting minutes which did not highlight further imminent cuts. In the minutes, members said the recent rate cut did not “commit them to further rate cuts”.  The RBA remains concerned about inflation even though it has dropped to 2.4% but there is also the threat of tariffs on global trade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Bullock has said that the RBA is watching the labor market, which has been resilient and not supportive of further rate cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday morning was set to see the release of the important GDP growth number for the Australian economy, with a robust number possibly adding to yesterday’s strength. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of Japan governor Ueda was also set to release a statement around the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders will keep an eye on Chinese services PMI at 9:45am, with the Trump speech to Congress at 10am in a busy morning for markets. Tomorrow will bring Australian trade balance figures at 8:30am HKT.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange rate has resistance in play as the market awaits economic data from Australia and Japan. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42902" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDJPY - Daily Chart" width="952" height="616" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart.png 952w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart-768x497.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDJPY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of AUDJPY has been testing the 101.40 level and is at risk of a move to 100 which can open a deeper correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday morning brings a speech from Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Bullock at 7 am HKT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An hour later, data from Japan in the form of foreign investment, with Australian employment data, arrived at 8:30 am HKT. Australia is expected to post a lower jobs number than last month with 25k jobs versus 64.1k. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBA Governor has hinted again that excessive government spending means a rate cut is not coming. Michele Bullock&#8217;s latest warning was delivered ahead of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates for the second time this year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While US rates are still marginally higher than Australia&#8217;s 12-year high of 4.35%, it&#8217;s another sign Australia is missing out as the rest of the world reduces rates. It is also an issue because US growth is much stronger than in Australia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms Bullock also revealed that she had personally told Treasurer Jim Chalmers that too much government spending was causing Australia&#8217;s inflationary problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My reading, when I speak privately to the Treasurer, and when I hear him speak on television and radio, is that he&#8217;s fully aware of the inflationary implications, of his own policies, he needs to be thinking about that, because he &#8211; like me &#8211; understands that inflation is really what&#8217;s hurting people at the moment,” she told reporters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failure of the Australian dollar to push higher from the current levels means the yen could gain some ground over the coming sessions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be in focus on Tuesday morning with jobs data and retail sales ahead. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDJPY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the AUDJPY exchange rate is trading at 99.31 after finding resistance at the 100 level on two occasions since September. That will be an important level and further weakness could retest the support at 94 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data starts at 8:30 am HKT with Japanese unemployment data. Strong employment and wage rises would pressure inflation and add potential for further rate hikes in Japan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will be followed at 9:30 and 10 am HKT data in the form of Australian retail sales and inflation. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been slower to cut interest rates as inflation remains stubborn down under. Tuesday’s data will conclude the high-level data for the week in this pair and could guide price into the weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of Australia’s big four banks are now projecting an interest rate cut by mid-February, after NAB moved its forecast. NAB had expected rate cuts in May 2025 but have now brought it forward by three months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Japan’s board members are split over their own monetary policy, meetings of the recent meeting showed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BOJ held short-term interest rates steady at 0.25% at its two-day meeting but noted improving domestic conditions, which will allow for the unwinding of years of extraordinary monetary stimulus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Private consumption has been on a moderate increasing trend despite the impact of price rises and other factors,&#8221; the Bank of Japan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Japan&#8217;s real interest rates remain extremely low. If our economic and price forecasts are achieved, we will raise interest rates and adjust the degree of monetary support accordingly,&#8221; Governor Kazuo Ueda said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shigeru Ishiba won a Japanese prime ministerial election on Friday and investors are concerned that further rate hikes and FX interventions may be on the way. Ishiba said he would clean up the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), revitalise the economy and address security threats.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33583" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDJPY – Daily Chart" width="769" height="607" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 769w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x237.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDJPY was trading above a previous high close at 103.46 and was trying to use that as support. That will be the critical level for Thursday&#8217;s data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese economy&#8217;s GDP growth figures for the first quarter will be released on Thursday. Markets expect a weak showing, with a move from 0.4% to -1.5%. That highlights the dilemma for the Bank of Japan, where raising interest rates anytime soon would take much work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rate hike could further harm the economy, and the bank will likely continue to focus on intervention to tame the yen&#8217;s fall. The GDP figure was released at 7:50 HKT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next release is Australian employment figures at 9:30, with a gain of 23.7k jobs expected. That would be a welcome relief after a loss of -6.6k jobs in the previous month and highlights another central bank under pressure to lower interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Australia&#8217;s unemployment rate is expected to drop from 3.8% to 3.9%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government figures said inflation in Australia will fall back within the Reserve Bank&#8217;s target range a year earlier than forecast. The statistics were shared ahead of Treasurer Jim Chalmers&#8217;s latest budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the numbers also showed that the economy grew slower than expected, and there is some &#8220;considerable uncertainty&#8221; surrounding the global and domestic economic outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chalmers said that his budget was designed to push inflation down, not up, but would also &#8220;make things a little easier for people&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, critics called it a &#8220;billionaire&#8217;s budget&#8221; after it emerged that all households would receive $300 off their energy bills to ease cost-of-living pressures. Citizens with several investment properties can also claim multiple rebates if the bills are in their name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders will watch the latest GDP and employment data as the AUDJPY approaches the previous BOJ intervention zone.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDJPY is coiling in a resistance zone, and the path ahead will be a breakout or a correction. The levels are 99 and 96. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Japan, the only central bank maintaining an ultra-loose monetary policy, is preparing to announce its latest decision on Tuesday, coinciding with the Reserve Bank of Australia&#8217;s (RBA) policy update. With interest rates in Japan remaining at -0.1% since 2016, the BoJ&#8217;s cautious stance is driven by concerns over slowing wage increases and sustainable inflation. It&#8217;s worth noting that the Bank of Japan introduced a distinctive Yield Curve Control (YCC) policy in September 2016, which it has been hesitant to modify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current price action shows an Australian dollar running out of steam, and the monetary policy announcements on Tuesday could create movement.</span></p>

<p><span id="more-24171"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/hubfs/AUDJPY%20%E2%80%93%20Daily%20Chart%20-%20employment%20data.webp" width="734" height="463" loading="lazy" alt="AUDJPY – Daily Chart - employment data" style="height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 734px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto">AUDJPY – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The AUDJPY has suffered over the last month as the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/market-news/rba-surprise-investors-second-consecutive-pause" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">RBA put the brakes on the rate hikes</a>. The pair trades at 94.00 with support 100 pips below and a potential test of that level coming this week.</p>
<p>The Australian economy is expected to suffer a decline in jobs added from 32.6k to 15k. The unemployment rate will also likely increase to 3.6% from 3.5%. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Unemployment Rate of 3.5% in June was a remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>A strong labour market and rising inflation have forced the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to hike interest rates to 4.10%, but it has paused lately. With smaller price rises, the RBA also watches the labour market closely, which means traders also use it as an important indicator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the figure comes in near the 15k mark expected, then there will be no action from the RBA and another dip in the Aussie dollar.</p>
<p>The Japanese economy will deliver the latest inflation report after the Asian session on Wednesday, with traders expecting a figure of 2.5%, down from 3.3% last month. But with<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/financial-events/gross-domestic-product" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">GDP</a><span>&nbsp;</span>coming in much higher than expectations, it is possible that there was some extra heat on prices.</p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s economy came in strongly for April-June, with healthy auto exports and tourist arrivals, offsetting a weaker global economy. But there are still recession risks looming across the world and some added pressure on Chinese property, which could give a safe haven boost to the yen.</p>
<p>The current trend would favour another move lower in the AUD vs JPY exchange rate, but the data over the next two days will confirm that. A hotter-than-expected move in Japanese prices could even lead to speculation of a tightening in monetary policy.</p>
