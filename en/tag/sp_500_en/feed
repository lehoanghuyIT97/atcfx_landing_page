<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPX 500</a> is now testing resistance at the 5,796 level and that is now the barrier to the previous highs near</p>
<p>The two economic powerhouses agreed to cut tariffs and de-escalate their trade war. Risk-on sentiment returned to asset markets after Treasury Secretary Bessent said trade talks with China were “very robust and productive.” The US and China have agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on each other’s products for three months, with the US reducing its tariffs on China from 145% to 30% and China reducing its duties from 125% to 10%. Treasury Secretary Bessent said that neither nation wants to “decouple” and that further talks might lead to “purchasing agreements” by China.</p>
<p>Markets will now see the end to the most important aspect of the trade wars and buyers could return. The markets will also be looking at some data from the US such as retail sales. Traders are now discounting the chances at 8% for a -25 bp rate cut after the June 17-18 FOMC meeting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earnings season</a> continues and data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence, said the market consensus is for Q1 year-over-year earnings growth of +6.7% for the S&amp;P 500 stocks, down from expectations of +11.1% in early November.</p>
<p>Investors will be hoping that the tariff drama is over and the SPX 500 can aim for the previous market high.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial commentator Charles Gasparino has floated a rumour that the Trump administration is considering delisting Chinese stocks in the US as another tariff hit.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48134" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48134" style="width: 748px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-48134 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SPX500-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="SPX500 – Weekly Chart" width="748" height="577" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SPX500-–-Weekly-Chart.png 748w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SPX500-–-Weekly-Chart-300x231.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48134" class="wp-caption-text">SPX500 – Weekly Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPX500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is stable above the 2021 high at 4,818 but there is potential for tariff-led shock headlines and that level is key support with 5,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gasparino works for Fox Business and his report said: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sources: Trump Administration is moving toward a possible delisting of Chinese public co shares on US exchanges. Incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins is likely to take up the delisting issue when he officially takes office. The possibility of delisting Chinese companies is fueled by both the ongoing trade war with China and the increasing enthusiasm within the GOP-led Congress to pursue such delistings.”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue may take a while to play out and may be part of the Trump bargaining ploy. But Zerohedge said that such a move could see US investors forced to dump $800bn of stocks in the short-term. It is also a possible reason that foreign investors have not been heavily invested in the country this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some hedge funds were bullish on Chinese stocks in the last two years after stimulus measures loomed. They would be forced to dump those stocks in the short-term and look for other avenues to trade in China’s exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest tariff news, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that it is “highly likely” that they will cause some inflation. That could force the central bank to reconsider its rate cut strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House is now negotiating with dozens of countries after the 90 day pause. Japan has sent delegates for negotiations and it may mean the worst of the tariff shock is over, but with some economic effects still coming from the rates already applied.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47873" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SPX-500-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SPX 500 – Daily Chart" width="940" height="576" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SPX-500-–-Daily-Chart.png 940w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SPX-500-–-Daily-Chart-300x184.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SPX-500-–-Daily-Chart-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SPX 500 – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPX 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had tumbled after failing to find support at the 5,721 level, where Trump’s election win sparked a rally. The support then played out perfectly with a move through 5,389 level heading rapidly to the 2022 high around 4,818.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street stocks surged after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause in tariffs last week after markets erased trillions of dollars from global stock market valuations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy changes also include a lowered overall tariff of 10% during the 90-day period, and an increase in tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, from the 104% that went into effect overnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benchmark US Treasury yields pared gains after the tariff announcement, following a government auction of $39 billion 10-year bonds. Strong demand was still present after a market rout that sent traders running to cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been great news for the market&#8230; to see US bonds sell off has been very strange, amid a broader emphasis on taking risk off in portfolios. Seeing stress build in the credit market was really worrying. So today was a great relief,” Tom Bruce of Tanglewood Wealth Management said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are always the safe haven in troubled times, but markets are worried about the US dollar’s long-term stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s beginning to look like this thing has been all about China. Certainly, the big tariffs package just didn’t make sense to economists like me. It felt like they were creating maximum leverage by creating maximum chaos &#8212; classic game theory. So we needed a reprieve from that, and got one,” Bruce added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tariff slide has receded from markets, but the volatility was a warning that stocks are highly valued and at risk of a market turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US President Donald Trump has unveiled his “Liberation day” tariffs on Tuesday, saying jobs and factories will “come roaring back” to the US</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For decades, our country has been looted, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike. American steel workers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen &#8212; we have a lot of them here with us today. They really suffered gravely”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a few moments, I will sign a historic Executive Order, reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal. That means they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple. Can’t get any simpler than that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said the reciprocal tariffs will bring “stronger competition and lower prices for consumers” in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the President announced a baseline tariff rate of 10% for all countries (below the 15% consensus and 20% worst case) beginning April 5th. He also confirmed the 25% tariff on all auto imports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian countries on the list included China, Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America, because there is no tariff if you build your plant, your product in America,” Trump said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Likewise to all of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs, I say terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers, don’t manipulate your currencies&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock market fell as traders looked at the fallout from global trade volatility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Hetts, global head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson, commented:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eye-watering tariffs on a country-by-country basis scream ‘negotiation tactic,’ which will keep markets on edge for the foreseeable future”.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SPX500 – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPX 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has slumped from resistance above the 6,000 level and has moved below 5,800. The Trump election win started a rally at the 5,721 level and the uptrend resistance line goes back to the 2021 high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump’s election win in early November last year led to a surge in stocks and crypto as investors considered the potential for deregulation and pro-business policies. However, the tariff plans have been a negative for many business sectors and the US dollar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent slump in the US dollar could have Trump’s critics pouncing on the recent stock and </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drop as a failure of his administration’s early plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock market had its worst day of the year despite Trump stating on Thursday that most goods imported from Mexico and some from Canada would be exempt from his controversial tariffs, at least for the next month. The President was asked if the tariffs are scaring markets, but he defended the plan: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, a lot of them are globalist countries and companies that won&#8217;t be doing as well. Because we&#8217;re taking back things that have been taken from us many years ago&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said that the recent pause in tariffs was not linked to the markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing to do with the market,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not even looking at the market&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;ll always be a little short-term interruption,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be big, but the countries and companies that have been ripping us aren&#8217;t particularly happy with what I&#8217;m doing”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US stock market now turns to the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/financial-events/non-farm-payroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jobs numbers late on Friday. The data comes too late for Asian traders but could be a key number for the first days of next week. Economists expect the US economy to add 160k jobs after last month’s 143k. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent slashing of Federal workers by the Trump administration could show up in later releases but a weaker number this time could add to recent market struggles.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SPX 500 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPX 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has hit some clear resistance around the 6,100 level and could look to retest the uptrend support line. A move above 6,100 can start another leg higher with a real catalyst. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tariffs with China are an issue for the world economy and now Europe is joining the fray. President Donald Trump signed an order on Monday to impose global tariffs of 25% on all steel and aluminum imports. That would be good for domestic players but would hurt allies like Canada and Mexico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EU’s Ursula Von der Leyen said tariffs were taxes and they were “bad for business, worse for consumers,” and warned that the “unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered—they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Commission also issued a statement against the measures, saying: “The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By imposing tariffs, the US would be taxing its own citizens, raising costs for business, and fuelling inflation,” they added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock market investors are now stepping back to assess the potential for a global recession. The Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also told parliament that he has booked an urgent call with Trump for a special exemption from tariffs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia is hoping that its reported exports of 223,000 tonnes of steel, and 83,000 tonnes of aluminum last year, can gain some sway in terms of US reliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s 10% additional tariff on vehicles with larger engines imported from the US took effect on Monday. Exports are small compared to the number of cars produced but the mood is leading to investor fears over a variety of investment sectors.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fell last week with another failure at the 6,000 level hinting at a possible correction. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44745" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SP-500-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="SP 500 – Weekly Chart" width="876" height="561" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SP-500-–-Weekly-Chart.png 876w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SP-500-–-Weekly-Chart-300x192.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SP-500-–-Weekly-Chart-768x492.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SP 500 – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S&amp;P 500 has fallen to close at 5,827 and opens up the potential for a further correction toward the 5,000 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US December jobs report revealed a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, joined by a rise and acceleration in monthly payroll gains of 256,000. That ended market hopes for a January rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Before the jobs report, the odds were already low for an interest rate cut at the next meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a solid labor market and rising year-on-year consumer inflation rates, the next Fed rate cut may not happen until May 2025. With only a week left until Donald Trump’s Presidential inauguration, market participants may also be looking at taking some profits off the table. The incoming President has threatened to rattle the economic status quo with tariffs and other measures.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wildfires have continued to spread in California and an early estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses at between $135 billion and $150 billion. That would be the most costly natural disaster in the nation’s history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,” AccuWeather analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Around 1 day chart lows ($92K &#8211; 88K), bid liquidity has been buffered up a decent amount with increased demand,” he wrote. A move into those levels would break the long-term support line and put BTC in a pressure situation ahead of Trump’s inauguration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has continued to climb higher but has paused at the 6,000 level. The last correction was in July 2024 and cost the market 10%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The week ahead will start the upcoming Q4 earnings season with the big banks in focus from Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup (C) the week’s earnings, alongside the important chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key economic data will come on Wednesday with the December CPI report. That release of consumer inflation data could test the market’s expectations for interest rate levels if the figure is elevated. Weakness in the stock market is aligning with </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> testing key support, which may warn that some selling is on the way this week.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have started the year lower as the government heads toward a crucial speaker vote. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44377" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SP 500 – Daily Chart" width="706" height="556" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.png 706w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SP 500 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SP 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has dipped over the last few days to 5,899 and there is potential that the price can dip toward the support near the 5,680-800 levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are cautious ahead of the Friday vote on Speaker Mike Johnson’s term. The speaker of the house is a role needed to certify Trump’s election on Monday Jan. 6 and any delay would mean more voting and some possible nervousness about Trump’s January 20 inauguration.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a post-election surge in stocks and crypto, any delay could hurt asset prices early in the year. The President-elect has urged Republicans to support another term for Johnson, who has been in the role since October 2023. Republican Chip Roy has said he believes that Johnson lacks the support to win the vote this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remain undecided, as do a number of my colleagues, because we saw so many of the failures last year that we are concerned about that might limit or inhibit our ability to advance the president’s agenda,” Roy said on Fox TV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispute around Johnson’s role came as politicians battled over government spending, with Elon Musk vowing to cut $2 trillion from the government’s budget. The recent stop-gap bill includes $100 billion for disasters and support for farmers, while there is also a planned pay hike for the first time since 2009, who already make $174,000 a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors should be cautious around the vote on Friday as any delay to Trump’s certification on Monday could rattle markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Treasury yields pushed a little higher on Tuesday, which dragged chip stocks lower and hurt the broader market.  Energy stocks rallied after </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crude oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rose to an eight-week high. Low trading volumes still remain in a holiday week and may add to any volatile stock market moves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S&amp;P 500 finished 2024 with a gain of 24% and will start 2025 with some nervous political times ahead. The year closed with impeachment proceedings against South Korea’s leader and no-confidence votes looming in Canada, France, and Germany. That may hint at more of the same in the year ahead as spending and budget problems tackle established government leaders.</span></p>

The Dow Jones has now posted its largest losing run in 46 years nine downward days. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44063" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SP500-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SP500 – Daily Chart" width="981" height="618" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SP500-–-Daily-Chart.png 981w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SP500-–-Daily-Chart-300x189.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SP500-–-Daily-Chart-768x484.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SP500 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S&amp;P 500 rose above 6,000 and has fallen sharply on Wednesday. There is now a risk of further selling ahead of the festive shutdown and the new year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent decline, the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dow Jones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is still up over 15% year-to-date, after a strong year for the stock markets in North America. It also remains more than 3% above the level recorded during the presidential election, highlighting positive expectations for the next administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech stocks were also lower and will not be helped on Thursday after chipmaker Micron fell by more than -14% in after hours trading. The memory chip maker issued an outlook for the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/market-news/micron-q1-earnings-in-focus-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fiscal second-quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was well below expectations by a wide margin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data center business growth of roughly 400% year-over-year was positive, but the company is cautious about the PC consumer business, leading to the weaker-than-expected forecast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broader stocks were hit, and bond yields soared even after the FOMC cut interest rates by an expected -25 bp but signaled only 50 bp of rate cuts next year. That was half the 100 bp of rate cuts signalled in September. The FOMC also raised its GDP and inflation estimates for this year and next, suggesting that rates will not fall as fast as expected.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next three trading sessions could be tense as markets get ready to close for Christmas day. Year-end trading can often be a time for portfolio rebalancing as fund managers look to free up capital to purchase fresh positions for January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors may also take profits ahead of the incoming Trump administration in order to get more clarity on the President’s tariffs and business regulations.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43638" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SP 500 – Daily Chart" width="796" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart.png 796w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-300x234.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SP-500-–-Daily-Chart-768x600.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SP 500 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of SP 500 continues to defy gravity and there is potential for a correction sell-off. The year-end can often see profit-taking as institutions look to rebalance their portfolios for the new year. That could lead to some selling in late December. The first support level for the index would be 5,900. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks drove the S&amp;P 500 to a new all-time high and the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also posted a 2-1/2 week high. Better-than-expected ISM manufacturing data and October construction spending boosted the outlook for a soft landing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Micro Computer jumped 21% after a special committee found no evidence of misconduct by management or the board. Tesla gained 3% after Roth Capital Partners upgraded the stock to buy, but fellow automaker Stellantis NV was down more than -6% after Bloomberg said CEO Tavares is unexpectedly stepping down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets will now await the ISM services number on Wednesday to see how the broader economy is faring. The key number of the week for stocks will be non-farm payrolls on Friday. The markets are now discounting chances at 65% for a -25 bp rate cut at the December 17-18 FOMC meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions have increased their appetite for US stocks after the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/trump-economic-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump election win</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they expect corporate deregulation and other factors. Despite the recent surge there is still correction potential into year-end.</span></p>
