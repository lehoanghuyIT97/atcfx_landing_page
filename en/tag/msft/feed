										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar">MSFT</a>: A new rival to ChatGPT will add focus to Microsoft’s earnings on 29 Jan 2025.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">MSFT – Daily Chart</p>
<p>MSFT lost more than -3% on Monday with the stock below $30. The dip buyers saved it for now but there is risk of a move lower with earnings.</p>
<p>Microsoft releases its latest earnings on Wednesday after the market closes and there is now risk to the downside with the arrival of China’s DeepSeek AI tool. A clear threat to ChatGPT, investors will now put extra focus on MSFT earnings this week and could punish the stock with any negatives.</p>
<p>One issue the market may have is any sign of increased AI spending from Microsoft. Investors may also look for references to ChatGPT after a cheaper and more accurate model has emerged. Tech companies have been given high valuations on the belief that AI revenue was coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>That is now at risk and stocks could get hurt after the big spending on chips and data centers from Big Tech.</p>
<p>“Investor sentiment has shifted negative as a ‘wall of worry&#8217; around gross margins, capex, GenAI monetization and the OpenAI relationship builds,” Morgan Stanley analysts said. They also noted that Microsoft has underperformed other large-cap software firms over the last quarter.</p>
<p>Wall Street expects Microsoft to deliver revenue of $68.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year; with earnings of $23.36 billion, up from $21.87 billion. Revenue from Microsoft&#8217;s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure cloud computing platform, is expected to climb 20% to $25.76 billion.</p>
<p>However, markets may see a drop in cloud spending coming if the DeepSeek app becomes the most popular application for AI. Microsoft wrote in its blog that it was expecting a &#8220;new, large Azure commitment&#8221; from OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, but that was before this week’s news.</p>
