										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 7, 2024, the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/duke-of-edinburgh-cup-sponsorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duke of Edinburgh Cup</a> kicked off at King David Mowbray Golf Club in Cape Town, South Africa. As a long-standing partner, ATFX has been the official sponsor of the event for seven consecutive years, bringing this charity tournament to countries such as Thailand, Mexico, and Turkey. This year, ATFX introduced this philanthropic initiative to South Africa for the first time, aiming to promote the development of local golf and convey the values of charity and public welfare.</p>
<p>The Duke of Edinburgh Cup has been held in over 24 countries, helping children and young people overcome difficulties and lead better lives. Over the past seven years, ATFX&#8217;s charitable sponsorship has raised up to £170,000. Following last year&#8217;s Turkey qualifiers, ATFX raised funds for children and young people affected by the devastating earthquake in Turkey. Besides charity, there is also competition. In each match, the host country crowns its national champion, who will participate in the world finals held in the UK.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the South African Duke of Edinburgh Cup event, ATFX Chairman Joe Li delivered the opening speech. He expressed gratitude to the organisers for providing a platform for the company to learn about local culture and policies. He hoped that through this event, more help could be extended to those in need. ATFX&#8217;s prominent presence at the venue and in the local community also caught the attention of renowned media outlet The Citizen. In addition to comprehensive coverage of the event, The Citizen interviewed Joe Li and gained a detailed understanding of the group&#8217;s extensive charitable efforts.</p>
<p>In the upcoming period, ATFX will continue to follow up on the subsequent activities of the Duke of Edinburgh Cup, using actions to embody the social responsibility philosophy that the brand has always upheld.</p>

ATFX has continued supporting young children worldwide through the Duke of Edinburgh Golf Cup for five consecutive years in three different continents and is committed to continue supporting local communities in the coming years.</p>
