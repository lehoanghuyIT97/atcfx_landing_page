										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) released its latest <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a> ahead of the Asian open and a weak number could create a long-term high in the stock.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-43694 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CRM-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="CRM Weekly Chart" width="888" height="574" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CRM-Weekly-Chart.png 888w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CRM-Weekly-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CRM-Weekly-Chart-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">CRM Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The price of CRM has the potential to make a long-term high at this level. The 2024 highs are very close to the 2021 high and a disappointing earnings figure could see a correction.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Salesforce to report a 7% jump in year-over-year revenue during the quarter, boosted by demand for the company’s generative artificial intelligence (AI) product offerings. Analysts expect the company to post adjusted earnings of $2.44 a share on revenue of $9.35 billion.</p>
<p>Investors will likely be seeking clarification about demand for the company’s recently launched Agentforce platform, which enables customers to build and deploy AI agents for business functions.</p>
<p>Salesforce shares have gained 26% since the start of the year, in line with the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> over the same period. Piper Sandler equity research analyst Brent Bracelin gave some insight into what investors can expect.</p>
<p>Bracelin has an Overweight rating on CRM stock with a $395 price target. While he expects &#8220;more of the same&#8221; from the upcoming report, he notes that the &#8220;narrative is shifting.&#8221; The analyst pointed to the growing use of AI agents, which Bracelin believes &#8220;could really be a catalyst that could kickstart growth for the company&#8221; in the long term.</p>
<p>&#8220;But remember we&#8217;re coming from a point where people were negative on Salesforce for the last two years,&#8221; he added. Despite some challenges, Bracelin sees a “silver lining” coming from free cash flow growth.</p>
<p>Analyst Gil Luria at D.A. Davidson is concerned that potential clients may not be rushing to get on board.</p>
<p>“While we heard from numerous customers that there was strong interest in AI tools and the potential business use cases of Agentforce capabilities, budgets for AI are limited and organizations are still in the early stages of developing their AI business strategies,” Luria wrote in a research re.</p>
<p>Traders should be cautious will any long trades here as the stock hovers near its highs over the last three years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US tech firm Salesforce will release earnings after the market closes on Wednesday.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34895 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CRM-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="CRM – Daily Chart" width="903" height="621" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CRM-–-Daily-Chart.webp 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CRM-–-Daily-Chart-300x206.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CRM-–-Daily-Chart-768x528.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">CRM – Daily Chart</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRM stock</a> trades around $270, which is support from April and May. A strong number could see a return to a bullish tone, with $290 being the upside resistance level.</p>
<p>Salesforce has been underperforming the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> and <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq 100</a> this year. The company reported FY24 earnings, which showed revenue and earnings growing 11% and 50% year-over-year.</p>
<p>The company still sees strong growth in its Data Cloud segment as it drives robust innovation through the Einstein 1 Studio. At the same time, it has also announced plans to create an Einstein Copilot with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Salesforce is a leading provider of CRM software that helps businesses improve their sales pipeline and other areas related to sales and marketing.</p>
<p>The company said in its FY24 earnings in February that it had generated $34.9B in revenue for the full year, growing 11% YoY. Management added that eight out of 10 large deals in Q4 included six or more of their cloud products.</p>
<p>The company’s Data Cloud technology is now approaching $400 million in Annual Recurring Revenue “ARR”, which was up 90% YoY. Salesforce is expected to deliver approximately $9.145B in revenue in Q1, which would be another 11% growth. Operating margin is also expected to grow to 32.5%.</p>
<p>Analysts will be looking for strong figures and would prefer to see some international expansion as the company makes almost 70% of its income in the United States. Stronger earnings and management guidance around the cloud could see the stock set a low at this support level and seek to catch up with the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stock indices</a>.</p>
