										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">UBER released its latest earnings, and the recent stock rally is at a key level for the ride-hailing app firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25651" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/unnamed-1.png" alt="uber chart" width="655" height="472" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/unnamed-1.png 655w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/unnamed-1-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">UBER – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">UBER shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> have surged from their lows near $40 and go into the earnings looking for a break of the resistance near $50. That could see a further rally if the stubborn resistance gives way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The company is a favourite of analysts ahead of third-quarter earnings, and consensus estimates for UBER’s revenue is around $9.47 billion, indicating 13.5% growth year over year. The top line is likely to have been boosted by strength in the delivery business and improvement in the Mobility business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, high sales and marketing expenses and costs associated with paying incentives to drivers in some countries are likely to have affected Uber’s bottom line in the third quarter.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts upgraded Uber to Overweight with a price target of $60. The analysts also lifted their earnings and revenue estimates for 2024 and 2025, adding that they expect third-quarter results to be “largely in line.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">KeyBanc wrote: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uber is positioned to benefit from the sector growth of retail media with its emerging advertising business, which is margin accretive. Additionally, we continue to see opportunities for Uber to expand within its existing verticals into areas like hailing, shared rides, and grocery delivery.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oppenheimer analysts maintained an Outperform rating and a </span><b>$65</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> price target. They see an “attractive entry point” amid a recent stock decline and ahead of a potential inclusion in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> should Uber achieve GAAP profitability and noted consumer tailwinds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An overwhelming majority of analysts are bullish on the stock, with 96% rating it a Buy, according to data from Factset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That should see a strong move in the stock if it outperforms, to the upside or downside, with the </span><b>$50</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> price level being a barrier to further gains.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">Given the way that we may be in a stop &#8211; start lockdowns for the pandemic for quite some time, the Uber share price looks to be one of the more difficult ones to make a call on. This is over and above it being in an already difficult environment. In fact, the fundamental conundrum that is the Uber share price can be made less complicated by looking at the two businesses it is most famous for, hail-riding and food delivery, separately.<br />
For instance, like many leading stocks in February, just before the pandemic struck, Uber shares were on a high. Indeed, they were closing in on their all time peak at $47, achieved the previous year in the immediate aftermath of their IPO.</span></p>

<h2>COVID-19’s impact on Uber shares</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">But everything changed for investors as soon as the gravity of the COVID-19 crisis struck home, with the Uber share price more than halving. This echoed general stock market declines. However, it was clear that close proximity between passenger and driver in an Uber, over and above the new trend for work from home was going to be a severe headwind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">Delivery boost to Uber shares<br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">In contrast, it was intuitive that a big winner in the social distancing / lockdown era would be food delivery, as consumers cut down venturing from their homes. What has been interesting in terms of the Uber share price is the way that from the May to the beginning of November there seemed to be something of a balance between the bearishness associated with hail riding and the bullishness of food delivery. This could be explained by the uncertainty regarding a possible second wave of COVID-19, as future lockdowns.However, led by lockdowns in Europe, investors had the answer that it will be the food delivery space in the ascendency over the near term at least.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Uber share price breakout</h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">What has been interesting though, is the way that the break higher for Uber shares on a deepening of the pandemic suggests that the market now regards the company as a COVID-19 winner. This point is underlined by the way Uber shares are now fast approaching its $47 all time high level, gapping up off the back of Q3 earnings. The Uber share price was also given a post by extra stand alone positive newsflow. This included California allowing ride-hail and delivery businesses to classify drivers as independent contractors not employees, as well as the recent London license appeal win.</span></p>

<h2>Uber shares Q3 update</h2>
<p>But as far as Uber shares are concerned it looks to be numbers which spell out the balance of the business: at the Q3 stage. $8.55bn for eats and $5.91bn on rides. As things stand it can be said that the Uber share price is well hedged by the company’s two main businesses. The revenue bias towards Eats over Rides does nevertheless, give the bias in favour of the COVID-19 environment, the one we are currently in.</p>

<h2>Uber share price: daily chart</h2>
<p>All of this explains why we have a break to the upside on the Uber share price daily chart. The prospect is that we could see Uber shares hit the top of a rising trend channel as high as $60 on a 1-2 months time frame. This technical target could be delivered, especially while there is no break back below recent chart gap support at $40.</p>
