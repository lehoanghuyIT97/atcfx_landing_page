<p>The GBPUSD rallied in 2025 from lows below 1.2200 to highs near 1.34340. That has proven to be a barrier on the daily chart and could be the top for the GBP.</p>
<p>The UK has signed what is being touted as a historic trade deal with the United States, and investors are hoping that it opens the door to smoother relations with the EU and China. British Chancellor Rachel Reeves described it as a “good deal” and the country’s Treasury Minister Darren Jones said that 150,000 jobs had been &#8220;protected&#8221; but that the government would “continue to negotiate in other sectors”.</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen may be the next visitor to the U.S. as the region deals with 20% tariffs, but she said that she won&#8217;t visit the White House unless an agreement to cut rates is made.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I go to the White House, I want to have a package we can discuss,&#8221; Reuters reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has to be concrete and I want to have a solution that we both agree on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UK deal has been seen as a historic move and a peaceful end to weeks of tariff chaos. Now the focus is on a coming meeting with China and these deals could put the focus back on the economic situation and see a resurgence in the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The rally in gold and the anti-dollar sentiment has been driven by the belief that the U.S. dollar’s hold on global markets is coming to an end.</p>
<p>Professor Henry Gao, a US-China specialist from Singapore Management University said that &#8220;in the short-term China might be able to stand the trade war pressure better because of the nature of the regime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the long term, the US may be more resilient&#8230; China may want to reach some sort of deal with the US sooner rather than later,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The Governor of the Bank of England has also added some comments after the U.S. deal, saying that he hopes the UK can “rebuild” trade relationships with the EU after striking a trade deal with the United States.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPUSD &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPUSD has a key target to the upside at 1.34 but needs to get above the 1.30 level first. The GDP release could give a catalyst for that, or could lead to a correction after a sharp rally in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GDP data is released at 3pm HKT and is expected to show a monthly gain of 0.1%, down from 0.4% previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leading UK business group has predicted a “long and challenging year” for the country. The British Chambers of Commerce said higher taxes and a looming global trade war were the causes. It now expects GDP to be just 0.9% higher by the end of 2025, a sharp downgrade from a previous forecast of 1.3%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The limited growth expected this year will also be driven by higher Government spending rather than a busy private sector, the BCC warned. The BCC added that employers will struggle to invest in 2025, as they struggle to cope with rises in National Insurance tax and the minimum wage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another round of tariffs by Donald Trump on products such as steel is another concern for the UK.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Foster, policy officer at the CBI business group, said: “At a moment in the economic cycle when boosting business confidence and unlocking firms’ capacity for investment holds the key to kick-starting economic growth, the escalating tariff situation in the US remains deeply concerning.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coming GDP numbers will be important to see if the UK can shake off the recent gloom and a sharp unwind in the US dollar against global </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may also be reassessed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A billionaire hedge fund guru has warned of a UK debt spiral hitting the economy if the current path is not altered.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45210" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GBPUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="GBPUSD – Daily Chart" width="877" height="586" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GBPUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 877w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GBPUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GBPUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x513.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 877px) 100vw, 877px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">GBPUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/gbp-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBPUSD</a> has bounced at the October 2023 highs and will look for a low there with the May 2024 highs also in play. The GBP may continue to see some volatility around the recent lows as new data comes into the market.</p>
<p>Ray Dalio, hedge fund founder and billionaire, warned that the UK economy was at risk of a “debt death spiral” after recent bond volatility. In an interview with the Financial Times, Dalio said the government faced having to continue borrowing more and more to service its existing debt.</p>
<p>“When you get to the point that you have to borrow money to service the debt and interest rates are rising, so that debt service payments rise, so you need to borrow more money to pay them, you’re in what the markets call a death spiral,” he said.</p>
<p>Dalio also warned that markets were not expecting the UK’s extra debt issuance in the wake of October’s Budget. Government debt issued is set to reach £297bn ($300bn) for this fiscal year, the second highest on record, with interest rates stuck at their highest levels in years.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury paid over £100bn to service its debt in the 2024 fiscal year, with servicing costs set to hit around £110bn by 2028-29.</p>
<p>“(This) looks like a debt death spiral in the making because it will either require more borrowing to service the debt that will have to be serviced, squeeze out other spending, or require more taxes,” Dalio added.</p>
<p>Daiwa Capital now expects the Bank of England to continue with slow interest rate cuts in 2025 and into 2026 with weakness in the UK labor market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, the current loss of momentum in economic activity and labour demand could intensify to significantly increase the risks that inflation will undershoot the target over the medium term. So, we still expect the BoE to continue to cut rates gradually, by 25bps a quarter in 2025 and H126,&#8221; analysts at the firm said.</p>
<p>There was further gloom on Wednesday with data showing borrowing rose more than expected in December to its highest in four years, piling more pressure on the UK&#8217;s finances. Borrowing of £17.8bn last month, was higher than the previous December high of £10.1bn.</p>
<p>Spending on public services, social benefits, and debt interest were all up over the year, while an increase in tax gains was offset by cuts to National Insurance brought by the previous government.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v USD price has moved to test the 2024 support level and this is now key support for the pair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain’s Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was urged to cancel a trip to China as she scrambled to soothe markets as the pound dropped and government borrowing costs rose. Sterling tumbled to the lowest level against the greenback for over a year on Thursday as investors added more risk premium to UK gilt bonds. Gilts are the bonds the UK government uses to fund its borrowing and higher prices put pressure on the government’s plans.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists now warn that the country’s growth stall and stubborn inflation will make it hard for the Chancellor to balance the books without further spending cuts or tax hikes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many are now talking about former Chancellor Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-Budget in 2022, which led to a spike in borrowing rates and cost her the job.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current Chancellor did not show up to The House of Commons and sent her deputy to field questions, where he tried to explain the market panic with geopolitical and data concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Financial market movements, including changes in Government bond or gilt yields, which represent the Government&#8217;s borrowing costs, are determined by a wide range of international and domestic factors,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But markets are punishing the British currency as interest rates will have to be cut to spur growth and that is hard to do when inflation is still hovering. There are some geopolitical fears as incoming US President Donald Trump may have an impact on the country with tariffs, but the reality is that the October Budget pumped up borrowing to invest in infrastructure and also made a big tax raid on business to fund spending.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPUSD &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBPUSD exchange rate has slumped since September as the new UK government ramped up taxes. The 1.2665 level has proved to be an obstacle and that risks a move to 1.25 initially. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound was weak despite the Bank of England holding interest rates at current levels. A more cautious Federal Reserve has traders expecting that the UK will still cut more than the US. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates were held at 4.75% following a divided vote among BoE policymakers, as they weighed up concerns over a stagnating economy and higher inflation. The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it was keeping rates unchanged on Thursday after cutting in August and again in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn’t a unanimous decision, with six members voting to keep the base rate at 4.75% while three voted for a 0.25 percentage point cut. New projections from the MPC showed also that economic growth will be worse over the final three months of 2024 than previous projections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank’s economists now see 0% gross domestic product between October and December, weaker than the 0.3% growth it had forecast in November. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell boosted the price of the US dollar as he projected higher rates.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed said inflation will remain higher than expected in 2025, and that it is now pricing in just two rate cuts in 2025, rather than the four it had expected. That was a “punch in the face to the market,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Investments. “That got everyone spooked,” he added. The UK has retail sales released at 3pm HKT on Friday and investors expect a jump to 0.5% from -0.7 last month.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of GBPUSD has dipped below the 1.30 level and a failure to rebound could see lower levels. The next big support target comes in at 1.27.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government&#8217;s independent forecaster has warned that UK debt is currently on an &#8220;unsustainable path&#8221; unless spending is cut and taxes are raised. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said that surging energy prices and pressures from an ageing population are risks for the country that could lead to a recession. Moving from fossil fuel vehicles to electric is also a threat to tax revenues, the OBR said. The group said that debt levels could rise threefold over the next 50 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher inflation is increasing interest payments for the country, which hit £7.6bn, the highest level for that month on record and a £3.1bn jump from the same period a year ago. In its fiscal risks and sustainability report, the OBR said the government had already spent as much this year to help households cope with the cost-of-living crisis as it did supporting the economy through the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/financial-events/2008-financial-crisis-3-causes-3-effects-3-lessons-learned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2008 financial crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OBR said bringing debt back to 75% of GDP &#8220;would need taxes to rise, spending to fall, or a combination of both&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The pressures of an ageing population on spending and the loss of existing motoring taxes in a lower carbon economy leaves public debt on an unsustainable path in the long term,&#8221; the OBR said. The government has committed to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered cars from 2030 and that will remove fuel duty as a source of tax revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK retail sales will be released on Tuesday at 8am HKT and analysts expect a dip from 1.7% to 1.4%. Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Labour party’s budget was “broken promise after broken promise.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They don&#8217;t like it, but this is the truth. They have fiddled the figures. They have raised tax to record levels. They have broken their promises, and it is the working people of this country that are going to pay the price now,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/gbp-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBP/USD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced a further decline, reaching a ten-week nadir and approaching 1.29. UK and US PMI data are anticipated on Thursday, and central bankers from the Bank of England and Federal Reserve are scheduled to address the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to a widespread Greenback recovery and expectations of lower UK PMI readings in October, the Pound Sterling depreciated during Wednesday&#8217;s trading session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is projected that the UK&#8217;s Services PMI will experience a minor decrease to 52.2 from 52.4 in October. US PMI predictions are mixed, with Manufacturing PMI anticipated to rise to 47.5 and Services PMI projected to decline to 55.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBP/USD Price Forecast</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP/USD currency pair&#8217;s bearish momentum has persisted, resulting in a decline to the level of 1.2910, as sustained downward pressure continues to influence the market. The pair recently broke below the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), which is presently situated at 1.3079, indicating that bears maintain control of the market. The subsequent critical support level to monitor is the 200-day EMA, located at 1.2847. A violation below this level could potentially signal further losses, potentially leading towards the psychological level of 1.28. The recent price action exhibits a succession of lower highs and lower lows, confirming the bearish trend that has been developing since the October highs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/mt4-indicators"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> corroborates bearish sentiment, indicating potential continued selling pressure. A bounce-back is possible if the pair holds the 200-day EMA, but the overall trend suggests downside risk.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPUSD &#8211; Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPUSD has rallied above resistance at the 1.31183 level but now faces a potential retracement. Support comes in at the uptrend line around 1.28 but would target 1.23 below there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday will be the key day for the GBPUSD with FOMC meeting minutes released. The central bank cut rates a few weeks back, but this is an important release to see what the underlying opinions were about the economy and the reason for the cut. Volatility should pick up and traders will be keen to predict a path for further rate cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation data follows on Thursday with core and base </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-cpi-how-affect-forex-why-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due out Thursday and that report will also gain attention. The previous core report was higher than anticipated with the base coming in line with expectations on both a monthly and yearly level. A possible revision could also come and the focus is on the Fed’s plan for November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further data comes from Friday’s PPI and core PPI release, which is similar to CPI and could further the trend from Wednesday. PPI is the producer end of price changes and both readings were higher than expected last month so traders will be keen to see if inflation is still falling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early US Dock Worker strike on the eastern coast should support the price of the dollar and there is also a potential for further tension in the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No action was seen as of Sunday afternoon, but it is unlikely that Israel will not retaliate to the missile attack last week. The US has urged Israel not to strike Iran&#8217;s oil facilities and urged the country to think about &#8220;other alternatives&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any escalation could see the US dollar supported and recent economic issues in the UK could also hurt the pound as the new government faced difficult decisions.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/gbp-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBPUSD</a> exchange rate gained on Thursday after the Bank of England kept interest rates steady at 5%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40807 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GBPUSD-–-Daily-Chart.avif" alt="GBPUSD – Daily Chart" width="862" height="589" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GBPUSD-–-Daily-Chart.avif 862w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GBPUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x205.avif 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GBPUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x525.avif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GBPUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The BoE kept its key interest rate unchanged at 5% due to ongoing concerns about inflation within the bank&#8217;s monetary policy committee. The important services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy, has seen elevated prices. Figures on Wednesday showed that inflation overall in the UK remained at an annual rate of 2.2% in August, still above the bank&#8217;s goal.</p>
<p>Minutes of the bank&#8217;s latest meeting showed that eight out of the nine members of the panel voted to keep rates unchanged, while only one backed a quarter-point reduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economy has been evolving broadly as we expected. If that continues, we should be able to reduce rates gradually over time,&#8221; said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. &#8220;But it&#8217;s vital that inflation stays low, so we need to be careful not to cut too fast or by too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BoE is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, which follows the new government&#8217;s budget on October 30. The Labour government has said that it needs to plug a £22 billion pound ($29 billion) hole in the public finances and has indicated that it may need to raise taxes and lower spending. That could weigh on the near-term outlook for the British economy and put downward pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>The deputy chief economist at Aberdeen, Luke Bartholomew, said the Bank of England &#8220;will need to incorporate any fiscal changes in its next forecasts, which could provide the foundation for more rapid cuts in due course.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39740" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GBPUSD-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="GBPUSD – Weekly Chart" width="657" height="628" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GBPUSD-–-Weekly-Chart.png 657w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GBPUSD-–-Weekly-Chart-300x287.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPUSD – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPUSD on the weekly chart has risen to 1.3089 and is now only 50 pips away from the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/gbpusd-correction-uk-gdp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June 2023 highs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Price action will determine whether we see a continued rally or a correction unfold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest Treasury figures showed forecasters see UK economic growth to rise 1.1% for 2024, up from 0.9% last month. For 2025, forecasts were upgraded from 1.3% to 1.4, on average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That followed a better-than-expected first half of the year, with GDP ahead of forecasts. At the same time, inflation is expected to slow to the Bank of England&#8217;s 2%, leading to further cuts in interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital Economics and Pantheon analysts were two of the most bullish of the seven firms updating their predictions, with each seeing growth at 1.2%. Beacon Economic Forecasting was the most positive, predicting growth of 1.4% for the year. The forecasts are much higher than the IMF&#8217;s January prediction that UK growth would come in at 0.6% and the OECD&#8217;s May forecast of 0.4%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBS is the least confident of the recent updates, forecasting 2024 growth of 0.7%, while the British Chamber of Commerce also expects just 0.8%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a note on Tuesday, UBS economist Samuel Adams said that UK GDP growth of 0.7 and 0.6% in the first and second quarters &#8220;looks like an economy that is roaring back from its recession at the end of last year&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he warned that &#8220;this impression may be deceiving&#8221;. &#8220;Much of the growth has come from the public sector—unsurprising, given the easing to public sector strikes&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UBS analyst urged caution on the latest growth updates until further data is available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar was also weaker on Wednesday&#8217;s FOMC meeting minutes, which showed officials favoured an imminent rate cut in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minutes from the July 30-31 meeting found the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of policymakers &#8220;observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weakness in the US dollar and upgrades to the UK economy have led to a continued rally in the British pound. That could come under pressure at the June 2023 highs, which could be hit as early as this week.</span></p>
