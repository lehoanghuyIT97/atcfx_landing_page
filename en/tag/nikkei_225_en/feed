										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese inflation data will be released on Friday, and it could test the recent bounce in Nikkei stocks. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39820" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/JPN225-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="JPN225 – Daily Chart" width="840" height="592" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/JPN225-–-Daily-Chart.png 840w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/JPN225-–-Daily-Chart-300x211.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/JPN225-–-Daily-Chart-768x541.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">JPN225 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JPN225</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has bounced from the low in early August and is trading just above support. Inflation data and weakness in the US indices on Thursday may bring sellers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation data was released at 7:30 am HKT, and traders were looking at last month&#8217;s 2.8% rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent comments from Japanese policymakers have hinted at further rate hikes. They could hurt the Nikkei if traders see additional rate hikes coming. A higher-than-expected inflation number would put pressure on policymakers to act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent reading of wholesale inflation released last week showed the fastest year-on-year pace in 11 months. A weaker yen pushed </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> import prices higher for the economy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Bank of Japan, the corporate goods price index (CGPI) highlights the price companies charge each other for goods and services, which climbed 3% in July from a year ago. An economist survey showed that 57% expect the Bank of Japan to raise rates again this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The current policy rate is extremely accommodative,&#8221; said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research. &#8220;The BOJ will continue to raise interest rates toward the neutral rate as long as the 2% price stability target is expected to be achieved&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, the BOJ surprised many market participants by raising borrowing costs to 0.25% from 0%-0.1%. Governor Kazuo Ueda&#8217;s comments signalled the potential for further rate hikes in coming years. That led to a surge in the yen and a collapse in the Nikkei index. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is too early to assume that the market turmoil after the July additional rate hike has changed the path the BOJ envisions for rate hikes,&#8221; Kazutaka Maeda at Meiji Yasuda Research said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That outlook could be determined by the coming inflation figures and continued strength in the Japanese economy. Japan&#8217;s economy grew by a much faster-than-expected 3.1% annual rate in the second quarter, recovering from a slump at the start of the year after consumption increased. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short term, Thursday&#8217;s sell-off in US stocks could hurt Asian stocks on Friday. Investors will then look ahead to Nvidia&#8217;s earnings release next week.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Nikkei shows signs of a top in the daily chart and could be corrected further.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26316" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nikkei-chart.png" alt="nikkei chart" width="940" height="506" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nikkei-chart.png 940w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nikkei-chart-300x161.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nikkei-chart-768x413.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">JPN225 – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikkei index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> found resistance at the 33,828 level, the highest in June this year. There is now potential for another retracement of similar size. That would initially put support around 32,500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Further chances of a high are accompanied by media expectations for a further rally. A Reuters poll said the index could rise to 35,000 by mid-2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Japan&#8217;s share average has returned more than 28% this year. All respondents forecast continued earnings growth despite tailwinds from a weaker yen starting to dissipate with the Bank of Japan approaching the end of its stimulus and the Federal Reserve tightening, reaching an end. The consensus for the Nikkei&#8217;s level in mid-2024 was 35,000, with responses ranging from 31,143 to 39,500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui in Tokyo, said that pent-up demand in business investment and consumer demand would lead to the Nikkei reaching 39,500 in June and 40,900 by the end of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are positives for the Japanese market. Half of the listed Japanese companies trade below book value, while 20% hold more cash than their market cap. Corporate profits ex-financials reached a record of 32 trillion yen in the April-June quarter. However, a weakening dollar and stronger yen are now a headwind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recent surveys also show that inflation expectations are finally picking up, which may lead households to invest some of the 1,000 trillion yen they currently keep in cash and deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We are constructive mainly because we are optimistic about nominal GDP growth,&#8221; Kichikawa said. &#8220;There is still room for equity prices to reflect the better picture in EPS growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other survey respondents said the yen may have bottomed after pushing near 152 per dollar earlier in the month. The Bank of Japan is expected to exit its hostile interest rate policy early next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the median poll response, that could lead to some stagnation for equities in the latter half of next year, with the Nikkei still stuck at 35,000 at year-end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the near term, stagnation may have arrived with the resistance barrier at 33,800, and Japanese stocks may cool by year-end.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 16px;line-height: 1">JPN225: Weekly Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">The Nikkei trades at 32,077 after a drop from resistance at 33,000 last week. Support lies at the 30,670 level.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">Japan&#8217;s share average fell after declines in heavyweight chip-related stocks, but value stocks saw limited losses as investors looked for dividends.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">&#8220;Growth shares weakened amid concern about rising US Treasury yields,&#8221; said Takehiko Masuzawa, head trader at Phillip Securities.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">&#8220;While gains in value stocks supported the market as investors bought stocks with higher dividend payouts,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">Investors need to buy dividend stocks before the next trading session in order to qualify for payouts from companies making their half-year cutoff.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">US Treasury yields are at their highest level since 2007, and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, believes the economy is not ready for another jump.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">&#8220;I am not sure if the world is prepared for 7%,&#8221; Dimon said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">&#8220;Going from 0% to 2% was almost no increase. Going from 0% to 5% caught some people off guard, but no one would have taken 5% out of the realm of possibility. I&#8217;m not sure if the world is prepared for 7%.&#8221;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">That quote will have many investors worried after the March regional banking crisis in the US. Yields were much lower then and may cause more turmoil if inflation cannot be contained.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">Oil prices are not helping, with a two-day surge bringing prices back above $93 per barrel.<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/live-chart/crude-oil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crude oil prices</a><span>&nbsp;</span>moved higher today after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 2.2 million barrels for the week to September 22.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2.5">Investors are also looking ahead to data from the Chinese economy in order to price the Nikkei, while fears over the country’s property sector have also weighed. Chinese property woes are weighing after developer Evergrande defaulted on its 4 billion yuan onshore bond repayment and delayed the restructuring meetings. Fears over a US government shutdown have also weighed, but the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/markets/indices-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US stock indices</a><span>&nbsp;</span>rallied into the close of Wednesday and should boost Asian indices to the end of the week.</p>
