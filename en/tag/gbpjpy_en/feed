<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBP v JPY has resistance at the 194.71 level which has been an obstacle for the pair in January and April. Another failure at that failure could see a correction in the pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British retail sales numbers are released on Friday at 2pm HKT with economists expecting to see a monthly dip of 0.4% to 0.2%. However, the yearly figure is expected to show an increase from 2.6% to 4.5%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound was trading close to its highest level against the US dollar since 2022 as hotter inflation and improving relations with Europe and the US continued to support the currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The trade deals are generally good news for the pound,&#8221; said ING FX strategist Francesco Pesole. &#8220;We still think the pound is in a pretty good position&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest inflation readings could also stall any future rate cuts from the Bank of England and support the pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BoE&#8217;s chief economist Huw Pill said this week that a quarterly pace of cuts was &#8220;too rapid&#8221; given still strong wage pressures on inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of dissent building at the Bank of England,&#8221; ING&#8217;s Pesole added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country’s central bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25% on May 8 in a three-way split vote, with two members favouring a bigger cut, and two &#8211; including Pill – deciding a hold was the best option. The recent positive sentiment should continue to boost the prospects for the British pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Japan&#8217;s government downgraded its assessment of the global economy on Thursday due to the uncertainty over trade policy. In its monthly economic report for May, the government lowered its outlook for the US economy for the first time in nearly three years to say its expansion was moderating.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPJPY – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP  v JPY has pushed through resistance at the 194.68 level and that becomes support. The next upside target will be at 198.20 for the pound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese consumer price index was released at 7:30am HKT and the ex food and energy figure was higher than expected. The standard reading stayed the same at 2.9%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors now wait for the 3pm GDP growth figures from the UK economy. The quarterly figure is expected to show a 0.1% gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Core consumer prices in Japan&#8217;s capital were higher than a year ago, staying above the central bank&#8217;s 2% target and keeping alive market hopes of a near-term interest rate hike. The data is closely watched by BOJ policymakers as a leading indicator of price trends and is showing that companies continue to pass on rising raw material costs to households.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A separate index for Tokyo that strips away both fresh food and fuel costs, rose 2.2% in March from a year earlier after a 1.9% rise in February, the data showed. The BOJ ended its decade-long era of zero rates last year with a 0.5% increase as the bank believed Japan was close to sustainably hitting its 2% inflation target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Kazuo Ueda said the BOJ will keep pushing up borrowing costs if continued wage gains boost consumption and allow firms to raise prices. A Reuters poll said many analysts expect a BOJ rate hike to come in the third quarter, most likely in July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new round of tariffs from US President Donald Trump is set to come into effect on April 2 and includes an import tax on foreign vehicles. That could hurt Japan more than the UK economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the tax burden in the UK is forecast to rise from approximately 35% of GDP in 2024/25 to 37% in 2027/28, the highest level since current records began in 1948. That is hurting any potential growth and keeping a lid on the British currency.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPJPY broke lower through support and is now pointing lower with the 188-190 level in focus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of borrowing for the UK government has soared to its highest level for more than 25 years as gilt yields continue to rise. Only months after the Budget, the yield on 30-year gilts reached more than 5.25% for the first time since 1998. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the yield on 10-year gilts rose to 4.8%, which is the highest since the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/financial-events/2008-financial-crisis-3-causes-3-effects-3-lessons-learned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2008 financial crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The yield is now also higher than the level they were when former Chancellor Liz Truss caused a mini-budget panic in the market back in September 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK government now faces calls to cut spending in public services and announcements could have an effect on the pound this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is undoubtedly a blow to Chancellor Rachel Reeves whose credibility with the markets and business leaders has been bruised by the Budget,” said Jason Hollands at Evelyn Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The surge in long-term yields represents a real challenge for the Chancellor when it comes to sticking to her fiscal rules. Ultimately, it will pile pressure on either increased spending restraint, or the potential for further tax rises, neither of which are going to be palatable to the public,” he added.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-44037 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GBPJPY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="" width="714" height="604" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GBPJPY-Daily-Chart.png 714w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GBPJPY-Daily-Chart-300x254.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPJPY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of GBPJPY looked to be heading for a test of lower levels, but was able to bounce back into the uptrend. The upcoming data could test traders’ appetite for the British currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK’s CPI consumer price inflation data is released at 3pm HKT on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting a drop in the monthly figure to 0.1%, but a rise in the annual figure from 3.3% to 3.6%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News from the country showed that cigarette and fuel prices appear to be moving higher again. The overall inflation level swung back above the Bank of England’s 2% target in October, largely because of household energy bills after the price cap rose. Higher inflation adds fuel to the British pound as traders expect slower interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. Food prices are also forecast to have edged higher ahead of the festive season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OPEC+ alliance is looking at postponing planned production increases next year amid weak demand and competing production from non-allied countries that could keep </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stagnant through 2025 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanjay Raja, senior economist at Deutsche Bank, warned of “pressure building” in early 2025 due to business taxes rising and a higher minimum wage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said: “Looking ahead, we continue to see more upward pressure building – particularly within the services basket as the rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs), the change in employer NICs threshold, and hikes to the national living wage all start to push prices higher around the start of 2025”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan’s economy grew at a faster pace recently, indicating more strength in the recovery. Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 1.2% in the three months through September, higher than the 0.9% analysts expected. The focus is now on the timing of a rate increase from the Bank of Japan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continued stimulus from Japan may help to boost the Japanese economy and the yen can still find strength again.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of GBPJPY now trades below resistance at the 199.55 level and that becomes the barrier to further gains. The lower level at 190 becomes an initial support for the exchange rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK inflation data will arrive on Wednesday at 3pm HKT, while Japanese export data comes earlier at 7:50am HKT. A speech from Bank of Japan governor Ueda could move the pair at 13:10 HKT on Thursday, but the headline will be Japanese inflation at 7:30am HKT on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound was hurt by data which showed that the UK economy grew by 0.1% between July and September, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The growth was slower than analysts’ expectations and a significant drop from the 0.5% growth seen during April and June, the ONS said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists surveyed by Reuters and the Bank of England had forecast an expansion of 0.2% for the UK, slowing from the rapid growth seen over the first half of 2024 when the economy was rebounding from a brief recession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reacting to the numbers, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was not satisfied. “I want growth to be stronger, to come sooner, and also to be felt by families right across the country&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan&#8217;s economy grew by an annualised 0.9% over the July-September quarter, government data said on Friday. That was slower than the previous three months due to weaker capital spending, but an unexpected increase in consumption was a boost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent resistance for the GBP rally could give way to a further correction this week if the data supports the Japanese yen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPJPY trades at 199.40, and the pair may move to the 200 level again. Support levels lie at 198.75 and 197.40. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese yen has GDP growth data ahead on Monday at 7:50 am HKT. This final reading should come close to -1.9% forecasts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday brings the latest employment figures from the United Kingdom. That reading at 2 pm will look for an improvement on last month&#8217;s loss of 178k jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK will soon go to the polls in a general election, and the Labour Party will lead by around 20 points, which would be the biggest win since the 1990s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The party must prioritise the country&#8217;s jobs market as part of its growth agenda. Employment is still lower in the country than before the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has been this continual growth, through recession and recovery, that has helped to pull up economic growth even as productivity has stagnated,&#8221; Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Wilson added that employment&#8217;s reverse means the labour market risks holding back growth for the first time since the 1990s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fundamental problem facing the UK&#8217;s labour market is increased long-term sickness. 2.7 million people are out of work due to ill health, up from 2.1 million pre-pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the yen, the Bank of Japan will meet next week, which will bring speculation of policy changes to reverse the currency&#8217;s weakness. Initial intervention has not led to further strength in the currency, and policymakers may use the meeting to telegraph higher yields.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPJPY has rallied ahead of a Bank of England rate meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33010" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPJPY – Daily Chart" width="783" height="625" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 783w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x239.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x613.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPJPY has rallied from support at the 191.50 level and has mounted a three-day rally. The price may meet resistance after the BOJ refuses to accept higher price levels. Necessary support would come in at the 191.50-192 level for the GBPJPY. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair had Japanese data at 9:50 a.m., the BOJ summary of opinions at 1:00 p.m., and the economic </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">indices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at 7:00 p.m., followed by the BoE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further highs in the GBPJPY could create selling opportunities with the Bank of Japan lurking with intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be very difficult for the UK and Europe to move in a very different direction from the Fed,&#8221; said Iain Buckle at Aegon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Bank and European Central Bank can start, but they just can&#8217;t go without the Fed or keep going without the Fed,&#8221; added Nick Chatters, also at Aegon. While the BoE &#8220;would like to&#8221; cut rates in June, they can likely only &#8220;get away with two cuts without the Fed&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The markets need clarification on the BoE&#8217;s mixed messaging, with chief economist Huw Pill arguing that rates may stay higher for longer. Holding interest rates steady could lead to gains in the pound sterling, but the Bank of Japan would be unhappy with further pressure on the yen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Kazuo Ueda repeated on Wednesday that the Bank of Japan may take action on monetary policy if a fall in the yen affects prices significantly. That was the strongest hint that the central bank could go further than </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ueda told parliament, &#8220;We need to be mindful of the risk that the impact of currency volatility on inflation is becoming bigger than in the past&#8221; as firms seek to raise prices and wages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki also said he had &#8220;strong concern&#8221; on Wednesday over the negative impact of a weak yen, such as higher import costs. He reminded markets that Tokyo was ready to intervene in the market again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29960" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPJPY – Daily Chart" width="868" height="543" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 868w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x188.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPJPY – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPJPY jumped across the 189 level to test 190 and will now look for a support level here. A further advance or correction is currently set up for the pound vs yen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key now will be central banks, with the Bank of England hinting at rate cuts soon, while the Bank of Japan may consider a currency intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the IMF, the Bank of Japan has been urged to end its yield curve control and large asset purchases now and then gradually raise interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Japan&#8217;s economy recovering, domestic demand is ahead of rising costs as the primary driver of inflation. The output gap is closing, and labour shortages are getting more significant, the International Monetary Fund said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The BOJ has been appropriately cautious, given Japan&#8217;s history of deflation and mixed signals from recent data. That said, upside risks to inflation have materialised in the past year,&#8221; the IMF said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing wages will keep core inflation, which excludes food and energy, above the BOJ&#8217;s 2% target until the second half of 2025, the group added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the near term, the focus should shift to tighten fiscal policy and wind down unconventional monetary policy, while maintaining financial stability,&#8221; the IMF concluded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The BOJ should consider exiting YCC and ending QQE now while gradually raising short-term policy rates thereafter,&#8221; the IMF said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement added that in letting go of its easy policy, the central bank should offer &#8220;clear and effective&#8221; communication that any rate hikes would be gradual and cautious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IMF suggested that the BOJ could also continue to reinvest maturing government bonds on its balance sheet to avoid market disruptions. The group also criticised the country&#8217;s energy subsidies and the plan to offer near-blanket income tax cuts as &#8220;not warranted&#8221; due to the country&#8217;s economic recovery and high debt-to-GDP ratio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given its temporary nature and Japanese households&#8217; low propensity to consume, the non targeted income tax cut is expected to have a limited impact on growth. In addition, energy subsidies can distort energy consumption and hamper decarbonisation initiatives and should be replaced with targeted transfers to vulnerable households.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes will come for the GBP/JPY exchange rate as the BoE looks to cut rates. If the IMF is correct, the BOJ will go the opposite way. There is also the issue of intervention if the Japanese central bank thinks that speculation is devaluing the yen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="line-height: 2">The 2023 gains in GBPJPY could come under threat with the British and Japanese central banks in focus this week.</p>
<p><span id="more-24533"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><span style="font-size: 12px;color: #000000"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/GBPJPY%20Weekly%20Chart.png" width="660" height="571" loading="lazy" alt="GBPJPY: Weekly Chart" style="margin: 10px auto;width: 660px;height: auto;max-width: 100%"></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: center;line-height: 1">GBPJPY: Weekly Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><a href="/en/markets/forex-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GBPJPY</a><span>&nbsp;</span>surged in 2023 and now trades at 183.17. There could be a significant downside to 175 or more if the BOJ were to turn bullish. That may take time, with 180 being a first support target.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The other bearish potential would be from a Bank of England Dovish statement. The UK&#8217;s 10-year government bond yields climbed by 4 basis points to 4.40% ahead of Wednesday&#8217;s inflation data and the Bank of England’s policy decision due on Thursday. The majority of analysts expect the BoE to increase interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.5%.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The UK’s headline inflation rate is expected to climb from 6.8% to 7% as inflation remains elevated.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The Japanese economy also released an inflation report ahead of Friday’s session, and the BOJ statement will follow a few hours later. The Bank of Japan’s aggressive monetary easing campaign will end eventually, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said today.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;The BOJ is sustaining monetary easing since various events occurred, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,&#8221; Nishimura told a regular post-cabinet news conference.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;But inflation is now accelerating. Given what’s happening across the globe, the BOJ&#8217;s policy aimed at buying time will eventually end and normalise,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The Bank of England is still seeing some inflation pressures and acting on them, while the BOJ sticks to its easing strategy. There have been some comments suggesting an end, with traders expecting rate hikes from Japan in 2024. Expect some volatility if the outlook for that happens more quickly.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The 553.6 trillion yen (US$ 4.87 trillion) of assets the Bank of Japan holds are larger than the country’s economy. The BOJ is now the world&#8217;s second central bank after the Swiss National Bank.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;The Bank of Japan&#8217;s policy is clearly not sustainable. The BOJ would suffer losses if it had to raise interest rates to, say, two percent,&#8221; said Hidenori Suezawa, a fiscal analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. &#8220;Also, in cases of emergencies, such as a natural disaster or a war, the BOJ won&#8217;t be able to finance government bonds any longer.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="line-height: 2">GBPJPY has broken out of a longstanding range in recent weeks but may be at risk after an inflation drop in the UK.</p>
<p><span id="more-23876"></span> </p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><span style="font-size: 12px;color: #000000"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/GBPJPY%20Weekly%20Chart-Jul-19-2023-06-54-15-9453-PM.png" alt="GBPJPY: Weekly Chart" width="546" height="477" loading="lazy" style="margin: 10px auto 0px;width: 546px;height: auto;max-width: 100%"></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: center;line-height: 1">GBPJPY: Weekly Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><a href="/en/markets/forex-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">GBPJPY</a><span>&nbsp;</span>is trading at 180, but it moved above there with the breakout, and recent bearishness could test the uptrend line.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The British pound fell as the UK inflation rate fell to March 2022 lows. The drop in inflation to 7.9% will ease some of the recent criticism against the Bank of England and could lead to a pause in its rate hike strategy.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The core inflation rate dropped to 6.9%, giving hope that consumers will start to reemerge from a fearful slumber. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a 15-month low in inflation after a bad run where figures hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October last year.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The Bank of England will be relieved that the trend is now lower and traders are scaling back their bets on further rate hikes. Japan has not touched its own interest rates, and that gap was set to widen with a resulting gain in the currency rate.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Producer price inflation, which shows inflation earlier in the pipeline, is also slowing, with the cost of fuel and raw materials dropping by 2.7% in the year to June, while the cost of goods leaving factories rose only 0.1%.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wanted to see inflation cut in half this year when it was running at 10%. If it continues to get closer to that level and further on the road to the BoE’s 2% target, then the British pound could see a strong pullback. That would start with a close below the uptrend line of the price channel.</p>
