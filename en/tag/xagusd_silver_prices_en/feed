<p style="text-align: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47442 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart.png" alt="xagusd,silver,spot" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart.png 840w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">XAGUSD &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p>The price of XAGUSD is approaching recent resistance at $34.20 and a breakout higher could another leg to the rally.</p>
<p>In recent months, there has been a drive to bring physical silver onshore to the United States, leading to a sharp rise in COMEX inventories, which are 60% higher since December.</p>
<p>While the official explanation points to potential tariffs from the Trump administration on imported silver, there may be other reasons for the scramble. Further confirming the scramble for physical silver has been a surge in trading volume since December in the Sprott Physical Silver Trust, the most well-known physically backed silver exchange-traded product. The non-physically backed iShares Silver Trust has been flat over the same period, highlighting a clear investor preference for products backed by real silver.</p>
<p>Another reason for the recent surge is that <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold has hit new highs</a> this year. Over the past year, gold has outperformed, while silver has lagged, but the dynamic may be about to shift. Silver remains deeply undervalued relative to gold, and a correction in that dynamic may be imminent.</p>
<p>With gold now holding the level above the key $3,000 psychological level, the bias remains to the upside. This continued bullish momentum in gold should create a strong tailwind for silver moving forward.</p>
<p>Silver’s outlook is increasingly tied to the inflation narrative playing out in the global economy. President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, set to take effect April 2, are widely expected to boost import prices. Economists estimate the inflation impact could exceed a full percentage point, while Fed officials anticipate a temporary spike, others warn of longer-lasting pressure, adding uncertainty to interest rate decisions​​.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41914" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/XAGUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="XAGUSD – Daily Chart" width="954" height="579" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/XAGUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 954w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/XAGUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x182.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/XAGUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x466.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">XAGUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of XAG soared above the all-time high mear $42.50 yesterday and that has the potential to spur further gains in the metal. The previous high will act as support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver is following the recent strength of gold as investors price in geopolitical instability and also see lower interest rates boosting the price of metals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/financial-events/us-presidential-election-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approaches, some high-profile business commentators are concerned that neither candidate is talking about the country’s budget deficit woes. That is helping to boost the price of safe haven assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US budget deficit grew to $1.833 trillion for 2024, the highest since the pandemic, as interest payments on federal debt exceeded $1 trillion for the first time and spending grew for Social Security retirement, health care, and the military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, has estimated that Trump&#8217;s plans would add $7.5 trillion in new debt, more than twice the $3.5 trillion envisaged from Harris&#8217; proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither candidate is talking of measures to right the ballooning debt and investors are turning to </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-trade-silver-9-easy-steps-to-get-started-the-ultimate-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold and silver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they fear the US dollar losing its purchasing power. The biggest driver of the 2024 deficit level was a 29% increase in interest costs to $1.13 trillion due to a combination of higher interest rates and more debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Larry Fink, CEO of asset management giant BlackRock, said that growth in private markets could mitigate the economic impact of deficits and high government debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, he said rising US debt is a &#8220;big problem&#8221; but that private capital markets can help the economy grow without adding to the deficit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real risk would be a slowdown in growth and that could see even more flows into alternative assets such as Bitcoin and gold/silver.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">XAGUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAGUSD has bounced from the $28.67 level but was initially weak, moving to $29.28. A move above $30 would be needed to reignite the bull move, but there is a risk of a drop to the downtrend line around $28. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver saw sharp losses for four days alongside other </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/most-traded-commodities-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with US dollar strength. The price of the precious metal has risen this year on signs of demand weakness in China, the world&#8217;s top consumer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, India lowered its import duties on gold and silver from 15% to 6% to support jewellery manufacturing, raising the outlook for demand in the world&#8217;s second-largest bullion consumer. US PMI figures for July will be released on Wednesday, with second-quarter GDP figures set to follow on Thursday, alongside the latest PCE price report on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both data sets will be an essential driver for the US dollar, impacting metals and other commodities—China&#8217;s slower-than-expected economic growth of 4.7% hurt </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-affects-commodity-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodity markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last week.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopolitical concerns have also driven safe-haven metals buying. However, a potential ceasefire in the Middle East has hurt the outlook. Donald Trump has also spoken to Ukrainian President Zelensky about bringing peace to the conflict with Russia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&#8217;s economic data will be necessary for metals. A delay in interest rate cuts in the United States will hurt the demand for non-yielding assets such as crypto or bullion. That will determine whether silver prices can hold the low of the trading range that started in June.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Silver – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver is approaching the $27 level and could take out the levels ahead of $30. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Powell reminded investors that the US central bank has time to wait for its first interest rate cut due to economic strength and recent high inflation readings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Recent readings on job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,&#8221; Powell said. However, Recent data do not materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labour market, and inflation moving down toward 2% on a sometimes bumpy path.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If the economy evolves broadly as we expect,&#8221; Powell added, he and his fellow policymakers believe a lower policy interest rate will be required &#8220;at some point this year.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His comments kept markets on track for rate cuts, but gold has also seen demand from central banks due to a desire to diversify from the US dollar. Ukraine also continues to attack Russian infrastructure, and there is a general mood of shaky geopolitics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, analysts at ING said that </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> holdings in gold do not align with the sharp price rally in March. ETF holdings continue to decline, currently at 82moz, down from 85.6moz earlier in the year. &#8220;There is plenty of room for investors to buy the gold market, but maybe we need to wait for the Fed to actually start cutting rates,&#8221; they said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets will focus on the US jobs number on Friday, where a substantial number could hurt gold. Silver has hit a two-year high recently and will also take its direction from gold and the jobs number on Friday.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 2">Friday’s US jobs numbers have led to a slip in silver as the hiring slowdown hurts the outlook for higher inflation.<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/markets/commodities/gold-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Precious metals</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are seen as a hedge against higher prices, and that will cool demand.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">In a new price forecast, Kieran Tompkins, commodities economist at Capital Economics, warned investors that silver could be neutral for the rest of the year. Prices could fall back to $22.50, he said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Tompkins said that the most significant factor impacting silver is the US dollar, and the British-based research firm expects the USD to continue to rise.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;In short, we think there is further scope for interest rate differentials to extend the US dollar&#8217;s recent rally over the rest of this year, weighing on the silver price,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Thompkins added that China&#8217;s growing slowdown could weaken silver jewellery demand, and soft electronic sales would also hurt demand for the precious metal. Global trends also suggest that weaker economic growth will be detrimental to silver&#8217;s industrial markets.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;The global electronics PMI suggests that there has been a renewed downturn in the industry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Given the slowdown in economic activity we forecast in advanced economies, we suspect activity in the electronics sector will continue to deteriorate in the coming months.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">However, looking beyond the current year, Thompkins said that he expects silver&#8217;s fortunes to improve in 2024. He expects to see prices end the next year at around $25 an ounce. The reasoning for this is that a shift in US monetary policy as a recession continues will grow investment demand for silver, which has been sluggish through 2023.</p>

<p><span id="more-24119"></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/silver-weekly-chart-struggles.webp" alt="silver-weekly-chart-struggles" width="736" height="552" loading="lazy" style="height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 736px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Silver XAGUSD – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The silver price is testing an uptrend support line at $23.00, and there is further support at the $22.00 level.</p>
<p>Another problem for bullion investors is the drop in inflation seen across developed nations. Many investors were buying<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/markets/commodities" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">precious metals</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to hedge against inflation, but the peak in inflation near double digits for many countries has stalled.</p>
<p>The United States saw a seasonal tick higher to 3.2% from 3% in its annual inflation rate, but core inflation fell to 4.7%. Analysts are still discussing a long way to go for the Federal Reserve, but at 3.2%, inflation is only 1.2% away from the central bank&#8217;s 2% target.</p>
<p>&#8220;Markets are doubling down on &#8216;soft landing&#8217; bets this morning after US consumer inflation slowed as expected, reducing the need for further monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve,&#8221; wrote Karl Schamotta at Corpay.</p>
<p>Further data on Thursday showed claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week. Economists had forecast 230,000 claims for the latest week, a sign that the booming jobs market is stalling.</p>
<p>Markets are now pricing a high chance of a Fed rate hike pause again in September, but they may be done with their hiking policy.</p>
<p>There are still beneficial dynamics for silver supply, with the World Silver Survey 2023 saying the silver market has been in deficit for the last two years. The deficit in 2022 was 237.7 million ounces, while the 2023 deficit is forecast to be 142.1 million ounces.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that will continue with the drive to green energy policies and the need for solar panels and electric vehicles.</p>
