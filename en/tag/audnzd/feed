<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42476" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDNZD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDNZD – Daily Chart" width="829" height="595" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDNZD-–-Daily-Chart.png 829w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDNZD-–-Daily-Chart-300x215.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDNZD-–-Daily-Chart-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDNZD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of AUDNZD was higher on Tuesday with resistance ahead of the 1.1100 level. A larger resistance comes in at 1.1150. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserve Bank of Australia governor Michele Bullock has told the Albanese government that further election spending will force interest rates to remain high for longer. If policymakers ignore the message to be “very conscious” about inflation in their spending decisions, a pre-election interest rate cut by May will not be assured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists unanimously expected the central bank to leave its cash rate at the highest level since November 2011. Headline inflation fell to 2.8% in the September quarter, the lowest level in three-and-a-half-years, which the RBA said was still too high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday marked 12 months since the RBA last increased its benchmark rate by 0.25%. In a statement, the central bank said that while prices have &#8220;fallen substantially&#8221; since it peaked in 2022, underlying inflation at 3.5% in the September quarter needs to be lowered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank has also revised its economic forecasts, which were released on Tuesday, and the bank does not expect inflation to reach the mid-point of its 2-3% target until 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While headline inflation has declined substantially and will remain lower for a time, underlying inflation is more indicative of inflation momentum, and it remains too high,&#8221; the report said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underlying weakness is also present in the New Zealand economy and the central bank warned it could get worse. &#8220;Rising unemployment is starting to create acute financial difficulties for some households,&#8221; the RBNZ said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBNZ expects to see a contraction in the economy for the third quarter, as it raised the cash rate to bring down inflation. Since August, the central bank has cut the official cash rate by 75 basis points due to lower inflation, but it has not spurred the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr told a press conference that the real economy was lagging the interest rate cuts and getting through that lag was a concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t want surprises or shocks to the downside during that period,&#8221; Orr said.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDNZD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDNZD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pair found resistance at the 1.094 level and now trades at 1.0886 with the potential to slip further to the 1.08 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation data for the Australian economy will be released on Wednesday at 6:45 am HKT.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q4 data showed inflation at 4.7%, down from 6.7% a year ago. A sharper drop in inflation could reduce the Aussie dollar’s recent gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Monetary Fund has warned that Australia will lag behind other developed nations in reducing inflation and boosting economic growth. Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers is about to visit Washington for high-level talks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With less than a month until the May budget, Chalmers will leave the country on Thursday to attend meetings with his counterparts at the G20, IMF, and World Bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economic slowdown in China, growing tensions in the Middle East, and the prospect of delayed interest rate cuts weighing on the global economy are topics to be covered at the talks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These evolving global conditions make it an important time to engage with my counterparts and international institutions as we put the final touches on the May budget,” he said on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest World Economic Outlook, released on Tuesday, the IMF forecast that headline inflation in Australia would ease to 3.5% this year, down from its October projection of 4%. However, the projections showed that consumer price growth would still be 3% on average through 2025 at the high end of the RBA’s 2% to 3% target band. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inflation figures this week will test those projections. If inflation is shown to be weakening more than expected, it could lead to a drop in the Aussie dollar.</span></p>
