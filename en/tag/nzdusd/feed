<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NZDUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of NZDUSD has dipped below the support at the 0.5860 level. That will be the key to a rebound or further lows in the pair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve released the minutes of its latest minutes at 3am HKT with traders looking for clues of a rate cut in December. The Committee eased monetary policy again with a 25-basis-point rate cut on November 7, following September’s big cut that caught markets off guard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed policymakers noted that the labor market had &#8220;generally eased,&#8221; while inflation appeared to be progressing toward the Fed&#8217;s 2% target. The Fed may be concerned about recent war tensions as that started inflationary problems back in 2021-22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/trump-economic-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump election victory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November has brought expectations for US tariffs, loose fiscal policy, and business deregulation, which could all raise inflationary pressures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is next up at 8am HKT with an interest rate decision and monetary policy announcement.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commerzbank analyst Volkmar Baur said the policy talk will be more important than the rate decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It cut the cash rate by 25 basis points. However, the indication that a move of 50 basis points was being seriously considered did surprise some. As a small open economy, New Zealand is often one of the first to recognize changes in the global economy. And more often than not, the central bank is not shy about responding to changing circumstances. This summer, the RBNZ&#8217;s hint of a 50 basis point cut proved to be a harbinger for the Fed, which surprised markets by cutting rates by that amount in September,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And at its last meeting in October, the RBNZ followed up its August hint with a 50 basis point cut. Tomorrow morning, the RBNZ will hold its last policy meeting of the year, and once again, the RBNZ&#8217;s statement may be more interesting than the decision itself”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets expect another 50bp move, however, what the bank says about the outlook will be more important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another 50bp cut is almost fully priced in for the next meeting in February, another 25bp in April and a total of 150bp (6 steps of 25bp) by the summer. I think this is justified given the recent softening in inflation and economic growth. However, if the RBNZ were to focus on heightened international risks and their impact on inflation in New Zealand, the market might be forced to reconsider,” Vaulk added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr said the central bank must still anchor inflation expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30154" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZDUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NZDUSD – Daily Chart" width="766" height="601" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZDUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 766w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZDUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NZDUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZDUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been on an uptrend for six days, and there is a sign of a potential obstacle here. Coming US data will determine whether it goes to 0.625 or drops to the support again at 0.605. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is still hawkish despite the economy being in a technical recession. A week ago, the local market was making calls that the RBNZ might raise rates twice this year from the current level of 5.5%. The date to watch will be February 28, when the bank holds its next meeting, and a shock rate hike would send ripples around other Western bond markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have got more work to do to get inflation expectations anchored to 2%,” Orr said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three banks said the country’s benchmark rate was high enough but would not rule out the RBNZ making another move. BNZ, ASB, and Kiwibank all noted that economic indicators were moving in the right direction to get inflation lower.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders were awaiting the latest FOMC minutes from the Federal Reserve, and that will be the short-term driver into the weekend for the Kiwi dollar vs the US dollar. Analysts need clarification about the rate hike path for both central banks, which has driven the current rally in the NZDUSD.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest comments from the Federal Reserve could reverse the recent rally in the New Zealand dollar if the Fed also takes a cautious tone on inflation.</span></p>
