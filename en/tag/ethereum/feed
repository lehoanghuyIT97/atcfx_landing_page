										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/ethereum-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has failed to find a bounce at recent lows as money goes to safe havens and crypto suffers. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48024" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="ETHUSD – Daily Chart" width="658" height="465" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 658w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">ETHUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum and other altcoins are at risk from a move to safe havens with the coin falling through previous support at $2,174. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit spreads have reached their highest levels since August 2024, coinciding with recent market events. The IEI/HYG ratio, which is used as an indicator for credit spreads, showed its sharpest spike since the March 2023 </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/european-stocks-slide-credit-suisse-signature-bank-weighs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley Bank crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other risk assets have fallen during periods of sharp credit spread expansions. The Silicon Valley bank fallout drove BTC to lows below $20,000 at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets have been on edge since the US installed high tariffs on China and other trading partners. A lifting of broader tariffs for 90 days has eased some fears but there is still tension between the US and China-the two largest economies in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have suffered with the recent market panic as worried investors take their cash away from speculative plays. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that he doesn&#8217;t see any systemic issues with the bond market amid the recent deleveraging in the sector. He also said that any Chinese dumping of US Treasurys would hurt its plan for a cheaper currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China and Japan have been selling bonds in response to the trade tensions and that is stressing the market.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week saw outflows of $795 million across crypto funds, including $751 million from Bitcoin ETFs and nearly $38 million from Ethereum. </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/ripple-xrp-pressure-despite-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> managed to attract inflows during the sell-off after the recent SEC court case ended. Ethereum has not been active with any product enhancements and investors have taken some money off the table.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/ethereum-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been unable to gain recently as </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin’s price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has paused. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45587" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="ETHUSD – Daily Chart" width="808" height="594" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 808w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x221.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x565.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">ETHUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of ETH trades at $2,637 after a dump to the $2,174 level. The coin may struggle without any news catalyst. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drop in ETH has been partly-driven by comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde on crypto. She said that the ECB was not planning a strategic BTC reserve and any adoption can help speed up the planned digital euro. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a press conference, Lagarde said the bank rejected the idea of incorporating Bitcoin into European reserves on the basis that it is too volatile and associated with anti-money laundering. Her comments came after the Governor of the Czech National Bank was said to be considering Bitcoin with a weighting of up to 5% of its reserves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Ales Michl acknowledged Bitcoin’s volatility when discussing the idea with the Financial Times. “If you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle, or the pioneer,” Michl said. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker. I would say, &#8220;I like profitability.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Czechia does not use the euro but is a member of the ECB General Council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central bankers are considering the idea after the Trump administration has committed to exploring the potential for a “national digital asset stockpile”, but said it would likely come from asset seizures rather than buying Bitcoin. That news has hurt the upward trajectory of some </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto assets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they expected to see fresh buying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mrs Lagarde’s said: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On this matter that you referred to and whether central bank reserves should or could include bitcoins, I think there is a view around the table of the Governing Council, and most likely the General Council as well, that reserves have to be liquid, that reserves have to be secure, that they have to be safe, that they should not be plagued by the suspicion of money laundering or other criminal activities”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as a result, I am confident that bitcoin will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks of the General Council,” she added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin and coins like Ethereum may suffer as crypto investors take profits or move into trending assets.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35372" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="ETHUSD – Daily Chart" width="805" height="592" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 805w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x221.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x565.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">ETHUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH fell back through the $3,700 level and is holding that with quiet weekend volume. Any further selling could erode some of the ETF-driven gains from $3,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock markets stalled on Friday as traders saw the chance of US rate cuts disappearing with solid data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin&#8217;s Exchange Traded Fund inflows were at their second-highest level this week, but that has not led to price gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 40% drop in meme stock GameStop soured the mood in crypto and other speculative assets. </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was dragged lower through the $70k level, with the all-time highs above $71,000 proving stubborn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, spot </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed their 18th consecutive day of inflows, higher than the frenzied price increases of February and March. Over the recent 18-day streak, Bitcoin ETFs accumulated more than 56K bitcoins, according to HODL Capital, or almost 7x the amount of bitcoin mined during that period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has not led to a breakout, but some analysts are still optimistic about BTC&#8217;s chances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looking at the current market positioning, I don&#8217;t think things are anywhere as frothy as they were in late March/early April,&#8221; Greg Magadini of Amberdata said in a weekly newsletter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can clearly see that the futures basis is much lower than around peak positioning and the underlying open interest is rather stable for BTC,&#8221; Magdini added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will likely depend on how stocks perform as markets readjust their hopes for an early rate cut in 2024. But that also leaves the market vulnerable to any bad news. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/oil-prices-rise-anticipation-fed-rate-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Central Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/usdcad-higher-boc-rate-cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have already begun lowering their benchmark rate. However, their economies are weaker than those of the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newsletter from LondonCryptoClub also said </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> weakness could help Bitcoin because oil is a significant indicator of future inflation and could lower bond yields.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks are hovering near all-time highs to start the week, and they could guide crypto prices this week. Any weakness could see a correction in BTC/ETH that drags on the broader </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34428" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="ETHUSD – Daily Chart" width="772" height="628" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 772w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x244.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ETHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x625.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">ETHUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH is trying to find support at a previous resistance level of nearly $3,730 and could benefit from SEC approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum&#8217;s sudden surge on Thursday paused, with analysts blaming a large sell order. According to blockchain data records, symbolic Capital Partners sold 6,968 ETH worth $27.4 million within a minute.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also increased sales across the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a hot print from the S&amp;P Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index showed output growing faster in two years. That number was added to the previous day&#8217;s FOMC minutes, with investors pulling back their recent bets in hopes of an imminent rate cut from the US central bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin&#8217;s surge this year was driven by the January approval for ETFs, which led to </span><b>$13 billion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in investment inflows via stock markets. With that interest, BTC moved from $42,000 to $69,500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the same entities that brought BTC ETFs—BlackRock, VanEck, and Ark—also filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF. The deadline for approval is approaching, May 23. Investors hope that an imminent approval will bring some diversification inflows to Ethereum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, there was &#8220;chatter&#8221; that the SEC has completely reversed its stance on Ethereum, providing a perfect chance that the ETFs will be approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong has recently launched Ethereum ETFs and is looking to go one better than the United States with Ethereum staking. The SEC drove investment companies to change their applications and remove a staking system.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staking allows investors to earn a passive income on their Ethereum holdings. Staking yields could increase demand for Hong Kong&#8217;s ETFs, which have seen lukewarm demand since it launched in April. Ether jumped from a market valuation of $377 billion to $450 billion.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">ETHUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH is now trading above $3,200; the next resistance level will be $3,500. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum’s price has been boosted by whale activity, with large investors buying $500 million of supply in only 24 hours over the weekend. Sentiments Supply Held by Top Addresses data showed that the top 1,000 ETH wallets held a cumulative opening balance of 69.51 million ETH on Friday. But that figure grew by 170,000 ETH over the weekend, bringing the cumulative balance to 69.68 million ETH. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts are looking at the coming Ethereum Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March, as something that can add to the attractiveness of Ethereum. A recent research report from digital asset firm Grayscale highlighted the project’s plans to become a more secure and scalable blockchain for decentralised applications (dApps). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale said the upgrade will be a strategic move to boost Ethereum’s scalability while preserving its security. The company also noted that Ethereum 2.0 has increased scaling projects such as Optimism and Arbitron. Those projects have attracted investors to their blockchains and helped to build ETH users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrencies are being boosted by investment flows going into the Bitcoin ETFs. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust saw more than $1.3 billion in shares trading in one day, the highest level ever, and </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surged past the $57,000 mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The move higher in bitcoin earlier Monday spurred sizable activity in the US-based spot bitcoin ETFs, with the group (ex-Grayscale GBTC) posting a record-high $2.4 billion in trading volume,” CoinDesk said. “As for GBTC, it saw its smallest one-day outflow of bitcoin since the Jan. 11 launch of the spot </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fund shedding just 921 tokens.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rally in </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has added to the market’s positive sentiment. However, it seems reminiscent of 2021, when Bitcoin and the crypto market topped with the Nasdaq. That led to a crypto bear market, and there is a risk that it will happen again if an adverse market event arrives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next target for </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/ethereum-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">ETHUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> could be around $2,550, with higher resistance at $3,585. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Executives in the cryptocurrency industry aim for the rally to continue, with a growing number of investors calling for new all-time highs in 2024 above $100,000. </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> recovered from a deep slump in 2022, rallying more than 120% this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It feels that 2023 was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful for 2024 and 25,&#8221; Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, told CNBC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crypto industry shrugged off some scandals and is preparing for exchange-traded funds from </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/bitcoin-rallies-further-on-hopes-for-spot-etf-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Blackrock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and further institutional adoption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think what the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> means really is that bitcoin is going mainstream, and that&#8217;s what people were waiting for,&#8221; Gauthier said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, there are hopes that </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/ethereum-surge-blackrock-etf-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> will also see an ETF on the market alongside BTC and attract further investment flows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryan Sean Adams, the founder of the Bankless Ventures investment fund, emphasised Ethereum&#8217;s profitability compared to other </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-blockchain-for-dummies-a-non-techies-guide-to-cool-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">blockchains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Adams noted that Ethereum is the only profitable blockchain, generating annualised profits of $2.7 billion. He also said ETH has a higher price-earnings ratio than Amazon, indicating its strength as an investment. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/can-ethereum-recover-losses-merge-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ethereum&#8217;s Merge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> update in 2022 also led to a less energy-intensive mining process, which will appeal to environmentally-driven investing. Digital asset funds have seen $1.76 billion of inflows in ten weeks, the highest since 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last week, Ethereum had inflows of $31 million, extending its positive run to five weeks, totalling $134 million as the top altcoin. The coin edged Solana as the most popular altcoin, with a market capitalization of $275 billion behind Bitcoin&#8217;s $854 billion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A massive short squeeze occurred overnight in Ethereum. The funding rate is the highest ever and signals total panic for shorts,&#8221; Matrixport&#8217;s head of crypto research, Markus Thielen, wrote in a report following BlackRock&#8217;s surprise application for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The asset management giant&#8217;s surprise filing came after the landmark June </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin spot ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> application, which could spark a retail rush to crypto assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is nuclear winter for everybody who doubted ethereum,&#8221; Thielen said. &#8220;Market-neutral crypto hedge funds are making a killing with these funding rates. Inflows into crypto hedge funds will be high on the agenda for allocators.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Investors are now awaiting the arrival of a BTC ETF where retail money could surge into crypto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ethereum has suffered price losses alongside the broader crypto market since its peak in late 2021. The collapse of the non-fungible token market and the decline of interest in the decentralised finance market blocked ETH.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initially, when people thought about cryptocurrencies, the first token that came to mind was Bitcoin. It is considered a leader in the cryptocurrency field, so many corporations now accept it as a store of value. Another formidable contender in the crypto market is Ethereum.  Ethereum has also proved to be a first-mover with growing price value and reasonable volatility. So far, the big question has been whether or not Ethereum will ever overtake Bitcoin in terms of value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX-ethereum-versus-bitcoin.jpg" alt="ATFX-ethereum-versus-bitcoin" width="1200" /></p>
<p><span id="more-10282"></span></p>
<p>Like most other asset classes, there are significant advantages of diversification through having more than one digital currency. Shrewd investors should consider having a small cluster of different coins instead of just Bitcoins. However, there is also a need to consider the crypto assets that will stabilize volatility and complement each other in the long term. A combination of Bitcoins and Ethers is a favourite choice for many investors as their differences and similarities, price trends, and technologies complement each other well.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 18px">Ethereum has network characteristics that make it attractive in the long term. </span></strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum networks may look similar, but they are different if their overall aims are considered. <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading">Bitcoin trading</a> started as a reliable alternative to having fiat currencies and also to keep transactions anonymous. It was a way to store value and have a medium of exchange away from the grip of institutional control. Ethereum, on the other hand, is intended to have its currency and provide apps and immutable digital contracts on its platform. With that, ETH is also a digital currency, but Ether&#8217;s primary purpose was first to facilitate and then monetize smart contracts and provide a decentralized application platform (dapp).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX-ethereum-versus-blockchain.jpg" alt="ATFX-ethereum-versus-blockchain" width="1200" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/ethereum-trading">Ethereum trading</a> bears a greater advantage from a broader perspective because it is a platform that still carries more room for innovative improvements within it. Being a platform that can carry out plenty of economic tasks places it a step ahead of Bitcoin, which so far remains a peer-to-peer value exchange system.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 18px">Mining characteristics that affect the value of Ethereum and Bitcoin </span></strong></h2>
<p>From its inception, there was a capped number of Bitcoins that can ever be mined. The founder’s code placed a limit of 21 million Bitcoins. Currently, the number of Bitcoins that have already been mined is slightly under 19 million Bitcoins. Furthermore, the reward for mining Bitcoins will also keep on reducing by half after every four years. The process is called &#8220;halving,&#8221; which means that it will avoid an unfair rush to mine the remaining quota, and in turn, there won&#8217;t be some price distortion. As the figure of existing Bitcoins rises, the coin will naturally encounter more scarcity, and that will create more value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX-ethereum-versus-mining.jpg" alt="ATFX-ethereum-versus-mining" width="1200" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, Ethereum does not have a limit on the number that can be mined, neither are there any restrictions as a percentage of the first number issued. Miners, however, find Ethereum more profitable to mine because Bitcoins demand more computing power, electricity, and related costs to mine them on the blockchain. Ethereum is popular with miners because it is cheaper and more rewarding to mine.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 18px">In summary </span></strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin is considered a very mainstream cryptocurrency, and investors and users alike may want a new challenge. Altcoins like Ethereum are gaining popularity and value very fast, and these all come with unique benefits and potential for further value beyond being a medium of exchange. Ethereum, in fact, hit its highest ever hash rate averaging 2000 Megahash in April 2021. Even while BTC remains a first-choice for many, ETH&#8217;s current value and potential to gain more value in the long term makes it a must-have coin for value investors.</p>
