<p style="text-align: center">XIAOMI – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>Xiaomi has been on an uptrend this year, which can continue to the 20.00 level.</p>
<p>The Chinese tech giant has now unveiled the SU7, a new battery-powered luxury vehicle, with the company&#8217;s CEO saying it will target Tesla in the world&#8217;s largest EV market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Xiaomi&#8217;s goal is to make a dream car that is as good as Porsche and Tesla,&#8221; said billionaire CEO and co-founder Lei Jun. Lei did not confirm the price of the SU7, which launches next year and is intended to compete with luxury electric vehicles like the Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan Turbo.</p>
<p>Xiaomi, founded in 2010, said it would invest $10 billion in EV production in 2021. The company is best known for producing smartphones cheaper than Apple or Samsung devices. According to data from Counterpoint Research, the company&#8217;s smartphones are the third most popular globally, with a 14% market share.</p>
<p>The company is now seeking to become a significant global carmaker within the next few decades, with Lei saying it will be the &#8220;final major entrepreneurial project&#8221; of his life.</p>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s arrival in the highly competitive Chinese EV market will add to the growing pressure on Tesla from domestic carmakers in the country. Elon Musk&#8217;s firm is expected to be overtaken by domestic rival BYD as the world&#8217;s largest EV producer by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>In response, Tesla is planning a refresh of its most popular car, with Bloomberg reporting that the company aims to produce a new version of the Model Y in China next year. Musk has noted the rise in Chinese EV manufacturers as the US carmaker&#8217;s main competition, describing them as &#8220;extremely competitive&#8221;.</p>
