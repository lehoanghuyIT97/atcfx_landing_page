<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44702" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BIDU-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="BIDU – Weekly Chart" width="781" height="564" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BIDU-–-Weekly-Chart.png 781w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BIDU-–-Weekly-Chart-300x217.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BIDU-–-Weekly-Chart-768x555.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BIDU – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly chart of BIDU highlights weakness with the 2022 lows in play at $72.53 on the US ADR. As with all Chinese heavyweight stocks, investors must ask how long they can trade at such a discount to their US peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu&#8217;s CEO Robin Li expects AI applications will grow explosively throughout 2025 and noted this in a letter to employees on January 1. He noted that the number of paying users for its digital library Wenku has surpassed 40 million and AI apps are also seeing strong user growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wenku also offers content creation and generation for users and as of November 2024, the app’s AI features attracted over 70 million monthly active users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Staying at the forefront means taking on greater risks and facing higher possibilities of failure. It means we must endure loneliness and misunderstandings, persist through trial and error, and quickly adjust and start anew when there is a setback,&#8221; said Li. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is risk as the Chinese market now boasts 200 Large Language Models but Baidu&#8217;s resilience and focus on scalable, industry-driven AI solutions may provide an edge for the stock to bounce back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock is starting to get more attention among US investment communities due to its low valuation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Baidu (HKEX:9888)</strong> is in focus on Thursday as the tech giant releases its latest </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BIDU – Daily Chart" width="967" height="597" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart.png 967w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BIDU – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/hk-share-cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu’s shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been on a rollercoaster after the government announced its stimulus plans. The price shot up from a low around 80 to hit resistance at 116. The price has now slumped back to almost test the lows once more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street is expecting to see Baidu to post earnings per share of $2.47, while revenue is expected to rise nearly 1.5% to $4.65 billion during the quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in August, Baidu delivered revenue below expectations, although its profit beat Wall Street estimates. The company has faced strong headwinds from the tough macro environment and competition. However, the company was positive on its AI capabilities, saying that it would boost its ad business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu&#8217;s AI innovations have been offering hope, but its core businesses have been stagnant, and AI revenue impact remains marginal. Over the last two years, Baidu has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street analysts are bullish on the firm but shares have collapsed with lower expectations for government stimulus. Investors will be focused on AI Cloud revenue growth, any updates on generative AI expansion and the company’s Apollo robotaxi business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Apollo Go robotaxi unit is said to be in talks with several firms to expand into overseas markets. Baidu said this week that it has brought down the production cost of its Apollo RT6 self-driving vehicle to 250,000 yuan (US$34,525) per unit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a trade event in Wuhan, co-founder, chairman, and chief executive Robin Li Yanhong said the RT6 is now the world&#8217;s only mass-produced Level-4 autonomous (L4) driving vehicle. That could give the company an important lead in autonomous driving for Chinese customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tesla represents another technology road map &#8230; [it] wanted to go from L2 to L4, and is still working on it,&#8221; Li said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese social media and tech firm Baidu released its latest earnings on Thursday, showing better revenue from cloud growth and advertising sales. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33896" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BIDU – Daily Chart" width="865" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart.png 865w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart-300x216.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart-768x552.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BIDU – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIDU </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened at around 3% lower, but the stock is still near the higher end of a channel, and a break above the $114-115 level on the US ADR would see breakout potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu beat analysts&#8217; estimates for first-quarter revenue on Thursday, driven by a rebound in ad sales and higher demand for its AI-powered cloud products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, China&#8217;s largest search engine provider, reported revenue of 31.51 billion yuan ($4.37 billion) from March 31, compared to analysts&#8217; expectations for 31.21 billion yuan as per LSEG data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu has been increasing its efforts to boost sales of AI-related products and services. The latest move is part of an image rebranding plan, even though the majority of the firm&#8217;s revenue still comes from advertising sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Baidu Core&#8217;s online marketing revenue remained stable, while the end-to-end optimization of our AI technology stack continued to propel the growth of our AI Cloud revenue during the quarter,&#8221; CEO Robin Li said in the earnings release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu Core&#8217;s revenue, including search-based ad sales, cloud offerings, and autonomous driving, grew 4% to 23.8 billion yuan. Revenue at its streaming service iQIYI fell 5% to 7.9 billion yuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to LSEG data, Baidu reported an adjusted net income of 7 billion yuan for the latest quarter, beating analyst estimates of 5.57 billion yuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said in April that the number of users of its Ernie Bot, China&#8217;s most popular ChatGPT-style bot, had doubled to over 200 million in recent months. The chatbot launched in March 2023 is in intense competition with other large-language models in China, including Alibaba&#8217;s Tongyi Qianwen and Tencent&#8217;s Hunyuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu said on Thursday that it is working to make its Ernie models cheaper and more efficient, stating that the launch of several lightweight LLMs in the first quarter had already made Ernie more affordable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba and Tencent reported single-digit revenue growth this week for the March quarter. Alibaba&#8217;s profit was 11% lower, while Tencent grew 54%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu shares have shown some recent weakness, but a sharp increase in AI users could help the stock price in the coming quarters.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu will release its latest earnings this week, with the Chinese tech giant likely to update further on its AI advances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30382" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BIDU – Daily Chart" width="751" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart.png 751w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart-300x228.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BIDU – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of BIDU has tried to find support here at 110.60, and that could provide a base for a rally if analysts like the latest earnings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu’s previous earnings release showed a revenue beat for the quarter with a 6% year-on-year increase to 34.45 billion yuan ($4.72 billion). That was slightly higher than analyst expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Baidu reported solid third-quarter financial results, demonstrating resilience in a challenging economic climate,” Robin Li, Baidu CEO and co-founder, said at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts will be looking for a similar performance after the US tech giants saw growth in cloud technologies, more substantial advertising, and the release of new AI products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research and development expenses at the company will be watched after rising 6% to 6.1 billion year-on-year, partly due to higher data centre fees to support its Ernie bot research. That rose sharply from 1% growth in the second quarter a year ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernie bot is Baidu’s version of the AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT, which Microsoft uses. Meta and Google also have their models, which are being integrated into their product lines. Baidu only started charging for a version of the Ernie bot in November, with a price tag of </span><b>$8 a month</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meanwhile, the US tech firms have begun to release premium and enterprise versions with $20-30 per user price tags. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest supply update on chips will also be a theme after the US previously increased its restrictions on sales of advanced semiconductors to Chinese companies, limiting their potential to develop artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the restrictions, CEO Li said Baidu had “a substantial reserve of AI chips” that can allow it to keep training Ernie bot for the next year or two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trying to find support, analysts will want to see stronger earnings and a ramp-up in plans for getting Ernie into the hands of consumers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">BIDU: Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIDU stock</a> is still languishing near the lows around 128 and needs a rally to target resistance at 136.</p>
<p>The tech firm plans to launch the service as a standalone app and gradually merge it into its own search engine, said the source, who declined to be identified by Reuters. ChatGPT&#8217;s technology is a large language model (LLM) that works by learning from vast amounts of data on how to answer human needs, offering information like a search engine.</p>
<p>Chatbots in China are currently focused on social interaction, but ChatGPT can also perform professional tasks, such as programming and writing. Baidu plans to incorporate chatbot-generated results when users make search requests instead of only links, the person said. Beijing-based Baidu has been investing heavily in AI technology, including cloud services, chips, and autonomous driving, as it looks to diversify its revenue streams.</p>
<p>At a developer conference held last month, Baidu unveiled three AI-powered &#8220;creators&#8221; whose technology allows them to assume the roles of screenwriter, illustrator, editor, or animator. Analysts at Bernstein have raised their profit target on Baidu, Inc. to 168 from 160.</p>
<p>BIDU shares have found some recent support but need to see buying to mount a serious challenge to resistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Q1 this year, the name of the game on the stock market has firstly been to avoid or sell stocks exposed to economic disruption, and seek out companies that will either be unaffected, or preferably may gain in the current environment.</p>
<p>This should be a relatively straightforward process. But in the case of the Baidu share price, as it is China’s leading search engine company, we have a good example of some of the pros and cons of attempting to catch a COVID-19 winner.</p>
<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener">Learn more about shares trading with ATFX</a></p>
<p><span id="more-10368"></span></p>
<p>There are several key factors applying to the BIDU share price currently, not least of which are its forthcoming earnings. Here we shall see how the company has been able to bounce back &#8211; along with the rest of the Chinese economy. The interest here is the way that having been the first into the coronavirus crisis, it was evident that China was one of the first nations to emerge from it.</p>
<p>The Baidu share price is primarily influenced by the main business of internet search and is online &#8211; away from COVID-19, it will be significant how much the fundamentals dipped earlier this year, and how much they have rebounded now. The main metric of concern will of course be advertising revenue. It does not matter so much that Baidu shares may be not directly affected by COVID-19, but more that companies in sectors affected by the pandemic, especially in the travel and hospitality sectors, may be trimming advertising budgets, or even have gone out of business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Baidu Shares: The TikTok Factor</h2>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">The fact that Baidu has 75% of the Chinese search engine market but has seen its revenues decline over recent quarter does flash a warning sign. To have such a dominant position and still be running just to stand still belies a fundamental problem. It is that the growth drivers in non search advertising and especially streaming videos. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">The TikTok phenomenon has been the winning one this year, even though BIDU shares have been supported by its own streaming video unit, IQiyi, which contributes nearly a third of the company’s revenue. Perhaps it could be said that the ideal split distribution in revenues at Baidu would be one third internet search engine, and two thirds streaming video, rather than the other way around. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">In order to avoid the search engine drag on earnings &#8211; the consensus for Q3 is 99c a share versus $1.31 last year, it would appear that Baidu will not only have to rebalance its business, it may have to pivot into other areas. Recent news reports have centred on Baidu buying JOYY’s streaming video player platform, something which is essentially a acquiring of growth strategy, while its own short video app, Haokan grows to critical mass.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">BIDU share price: daily chart target<br /></span></h2>
<p>The Baidu share price has recovered well since the March low of $82, having traded as high as $147 in January just before the pandemic struck. Since March the stock has via a trend channel currently based near the 50 day moving average at $126.
