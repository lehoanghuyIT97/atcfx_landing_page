										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>U.S. Dollar index (<a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDX</a>)</strong> has been under pressure lately as tariffs threaten to induce a recession in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46955 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="USDX_Weekly_Chart" width="873" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart.png 873w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart-300x196.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USDX-Weekly-Chart-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">USDX &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p>The <strong>USDX</strong> stalled last week after sharp losses in the prior week and we may see a move to the 100 level coming over the next week or two.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar has been falling and gold is on the riser as traders look for a safe haven after recent market volatility.</p>
<p>Daan Struyven, from the commodities division of Goldman Sachs, said that global economic uncertainty is heightening fears of a weaker U.S. dollar while driving higher demand for gold. In a recent interview on CNBC, Struyven said  that many investors and central banks are on a gold-buying spree as they move to safe assets to guard against Donald Trump’s tariff policies.</p>
<p>Traders are also preparing for the upcoming Federal Reserve policy meeting set for Wednesday. Although the CME Group FedWatch tool shows a 99% probability that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, markets will be watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting comments for any hints on the future policy direction.</p>
<p>Powell has consistently played down expectations for rate cuts, reinforcing the Fed’s cautious approach and that has hurt the USDX. Recent economic data has pointed to a slowdown in the general economy and that may be a factor in Powell’s latest appearance.</p>
<p>“The broader driver here is uncertainty and risks, downside risks to the US and the global economic outlook, and that is pushing down some of the more procyclical commodities closely tied to US growth, such as oil, but it’s supporting gold,” Struyven said. “We have seen very significant increases in investment demand for gold, and we’re seeing very rapid buying from central banks for gold as well”.</p>
<p>“Our forecast base case for (<strong><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold</a></strong>) year-end is $3,100 per ounce. But we think that the risk to this base case and to our $3,100-$3,300 range are skewed to the upside. It’s pretty remarkable. We have seen a rally despite a decline in speculative positioning. So positioning is a lot cleaner than before the rally”.</p>
<p>The current dynamic could put the USDX on a path to the key 100 support level and it may come with the central bank meeting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US election drama poll swings could affect the price of the greenback going forward. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40320" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="DXY - Daily Chart" width="768" height="600" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart.png 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DXY-Daily-Chart-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DXY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DXY</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has bounced from 100.61 which held the market rally through 2024. The dollar will have to hold this level or risk a further correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some confusion in markets may be occurring as polls show Kamala Harris closing the gap in the Presidential race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In overall voting, Harris is said to be leading by Trump, 48%-43%, according to one, which has a margin error of 3.1%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising expectations that former President Trump would regain the White House in November led to a so-called “Trump trade,” which believed his policies would boost corporate profits and alleviate the country’s debt spiral. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some confusion is now creeping into the market as investors are unsure what foreign and domestic policy will look like.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors had been moving into corners of the US equity market that could benefit from Trump policies such as tax cuts and regulatory easing, including small caps and energy shares. That idea also helped to fuel a rotation out of big tech stocks into other areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem in the outlook is the bond market with investors moving out of longer-term bonds as they worry about spending. UK merchant banking firm Close Brothers estimated that a second Trump term could create $4 trillion to $5 trillion of extra government borrowing over 10 years, potentially boosting inflation and hurting bond prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is unlikely that a democratic government will fare better on spending and that may be the reason that the US dollar is possibly looking for a rebound.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With GDP data ahead, the US dollar will likely break from a tight range this week. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32418" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="DXY Dollar Index – Daily Chart" width="1027" height="634" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart.png 1027w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart-1024x632.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DXY-Dollar-Index-–-Daily-Chart-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1027px) 100vw, 1027px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DXY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar index is highlighting a turning point for the USD, and this week, a breakout or correction should begin.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US economy&#8217;s durable goods orders were released on Wednesday evening, and the market expects an improvement of 2.5% from 1.3%. The following day, the GDP release will be at 8:30 pm HKT, but traders can use the levels provided to play a move outside the recent range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth is expected to slow in the US to 2.5% from 3.4%, which could affect the interest rate path. Some analysts are critical of higher rates for slowing economic growth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar continues to be a headache for Asian central banks, with </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trading at levels close to 155, which could prompt intervention from the Bank of Japan. Markets will also be busy with US earnings this week when companies such as Tesla and Alphabet report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some see the potential for the Federal Reserve to hold rates at higher levels on the interest rate front. New York Fed President John Williams discussed the potential last week for hikes but does not see it soon. Currently, the Fed is seeking a 2% inflation rate, yet recent figures are closer to 3%. That has dampened the market&#8217;s mood for summer rate cuts that could boost economic growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday has an important inflation barometer with the US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report, and it could mark a critical week for the US dollar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerome Powell and other central bank officials have continued to stress the need for patience. This week&#8217;s GDP number could be a vital indicator for traders over the coming weeks. Chicago Fed Reserve President Austan Goolsbee was the latest official to hit higher rates, saying the progress on bringing down inflation has &#8220;stalled&#8221; this year. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dropped more than 2% to a one-week low after worries over a wider Middle East conflict subsided with no escalation over the weekend.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DXY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DXY has found resistance against other major currencies at the 104 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next week will be important for the US economy as inflation figures are released. The country’s pricing index is expected to drop from 3.4% as it approaches the Fed’s 2% target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail sales will also be released for the US economy. In contrast, inflation and GDP for the UK economy could make the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/gbp-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most volatile pair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top Fed official has said the country’s strong labour market is starting to cool. This indicates that last month’s substantial employment numbers will not hurt policymakers’ plans to cut borrowing costs this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve, said last week’s jobs report for January showed the labour market was “remarkably resilient” — but other indicators pointed “to some moderation”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At this point, I suspect we will see further moderation of wage growth, with a gradual slowing in job growth and an uptick in the unemployment rate over the year from its very low level,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mester said her “base case” was for the Fed to cut the federal funds target from a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% “at a gradual pace” in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the economy evolves as expected, I think we will gain [the confidence to cut] later this year, and then we can begin moving rates down.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Michelle Bowman, seen as a more hawkish member, said last week that the January data provided evidence that the jobs market could lead to services inflation remaining above the central bank’s 2% goal. Data for January’s non-farm payrolls, an essential measure of the job market, showed 353,000 jobs were created last month, almost double analysts’ forecasts.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another policymaker, Susan Collins, said this week that the US central bank would likely cut interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point this year, starting once inflation shows another leg lower toward 2%. “I do expect that before the end of the year, it will be appropriate for us to carefully begin easing rates,” Collins said </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the outsized number, markets are not driving the US dollar. They will wait for some inflationary weakness to show up.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US dollar index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surged to a seven-week high after data revealed unexpected job growth in January, reducing the likelihood of imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonfarm payrolls increased by 353,000 last month, beating economists’ expectations for a gain of 180,000. Average hourly earnings increased 0.6% after rising 0.4% in December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It “blew away expectations,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. The market has further reduced the chances of a March cut and reduced the number of cuts (it expects) the Fed will deliver this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar had recently weakened in line with falling Treasury yields, even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that a March rate cut was unlikely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasuries benefited from safe-haven demand due to renewed concerns about the financial health of US regional banks. However, these concerns eased on Friday as US regional bank stocks recovered slightly from a brutal two-day sell-off, helping send yields higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent moves in the dollar and Treasury yields, in large part, also reflect repositioning, following a strong January for the greenback and higher Treasury yields during the month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After a big move in most of January, I would say there was some position adjusting,” said Chandler. After Friday’s data, however, “I’m looking for a firmer dollar tone,” he added.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29662" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MicrosoftTeams-image.png" alt="USX 4-Hourly Chart" width="1048" height="530" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MicrosoftTeams-image.png 1048w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MicrosoftTeams-image-300x152.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MicrosoftTeams-image-1024x518.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MicrosoftTeams-image-768x388.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USX 4-Hourly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar index hit 104.04, its highest level since December 12th. The euro dropped to $1.07810, just above its weakest level since December 13th. The greenback climbed to 148.58 yen, near its highest level since November 28th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, traders are now pricing in a 21% chance of a rate cut in March, down from 38% on Thursday, and a 75% probability for May, down from 94%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sterling fell to $1.2614, the lowest since Jan. 17. The British currency gained on Thursday after the Bank of England kept interest rates at a nearly 16-year high and resisted the likelihood of near-term rate cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian dollar fell to a 10-week low of $0.65035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, JPMorgan analysts Jason Hunter and Marko Kolanovic reported that the Aussie has been trying to stage a short-term bullish reversal at “critical support” near $0.65. They said that if it fails to break above resistance at $0.664 to $0.6657 and sees further weakness, it may next test support at the $0.617 to $0.6296 area.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dollar index</a> was trading at $100.95 and will likely test the $100 level in the next two days. That would then be the key level for 2024, with support below $98 and $95.</p>
<p>The US dollar is selling off as traders see the peak in Federal Reserve interest rates and a move to cuts. Data has also softened around the US economy, and traders feel that the dollar has outperformed some of the world&#8217;s largest currencies. There may be worries that recession is coming closer if cuts are not sharp enough.</p>
<p>Another problem is in the political sphere, where states such as Colorado seek to remove Donald Trump from the 2024 Presidential ballot. With other court cases piling up for the leading candidate, the months ahead of the November vote could become more contentious and hurt US investment flows. Further tensions between the country&#8217;s two political parties could spill over into the debt ceiling issues and other key votes in the year ahead.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s debt rating was downgraded in 2023 by two other rating agencies who cited that political strain, but the debt is a bigger problem.</p>
<p>Former advisor to the People&#8217;s Bank of China, Yu Yongding, also said the nation should not reinvest its US treasury monies.</p>
<p>&#8220;China should accelerate the adjustment of its overseas asset and liability structure, improve returns on overseas net assets, and lower the share of foreign exchange reserves in its overseas assets&#8221;. The slowing demand was as risky for Bridgewater hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a debt crisis in this country,&#8221; Dalio said, noting the massive scale of public borrowing and lower demand for government bonds. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re going to get a meaningful slowing of the economy,&#8221; he added. Dalio said the state of US relations with China and Russia was also a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; for government debt.</p>
