<p style="text-align: center;">CH 50 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China 50 index</a> surged to 12,316 on Tuesday, taking out four levels of resistance that were previously identified. The current level is the obstacle to further gains, with the May highs near 13,000 now in sight.</p>
<p>China unveiled its largest set of economic stimulus measures since the pandemic as it attempts to kickstart growth in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China said it had cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points and the amount banks must hold as cash reserves, known as reserve requirement ratios, by 20 basis points.</p>
<p>PBoC governor Pan Gongsheng said the measures should &#8220;support the stable growth of China&#8217;s economy&#8221; and &#8220;promote a moderate rebound in prices&#8221;.</p>
<p>Economists have been doubting the government&#8217;s 5% annual growth target as the economy battles <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/deflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deflation</a> and weak demand. Some economists are also unsure whether the latest measures would sufficiently address China&#8217;s broader economic problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a step in the right direction,&#8221; Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China Economics at Capital Economics said. &#8220;But it will probably be insufficient to drive a turnaround in growth unless followed up with greater fiscal support&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lynn Song, chief economist for China at ING, said there was &#8220;still room for further easing in the months ahead as most global central banks are now on a rate-cut trajectory&#8221;.</p>
<p>The 50 basis point cut from the Federal Reserve last week and the similar cut from China is a sign that central banks are worried about the trajectory of the global economy. Asian equities were boosted by the Hang Seng by more than 3%, while a 1.51% gain also supported oil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China&#8217;s latest inflation reading was lower than expected, and investors are looking for further stimulus from the country.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-32065 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CH50-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="CH50 – Daily Chart" width="841" height="537" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CH50-–-Daily-Chart.webp 841w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CH50-–-Daily-Chart-300x192.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CH50-–-Daily-Chart-768x490.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">CH50 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CH50 index</a> has been on a rally since January, but the price has now found some resistance at the 12,265 level. That could lead to further selling in the index if it fails to hold the 12,000 level.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s consumer inflation was slower than expected in March, and producer price deflation returned. Investors are now seeing further pressure on policymakers to launch more stimulus measures to boost the economy.</p>
<p>Deflationary pressures in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy appear to be easing, although a continued property crisis still hurts consumer and business confidence. According to National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, consumer prices rose by 0.1% in March from a year earlier. That was much lower than a 0.7% rise in February, which was the first gain in six months, and lower than an expected 0.4% rise predicted by a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>Data for January and February and factory surveys for March showed increased demand, but economists warned of Lunar New Year distortions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seasonal effects definitely played a role &#8211; food prices rose sharply during the Chinese New Year in February and subsequently came back down,&#8221; said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;More broadly, the overcapacity issue is passing into prices in a way that will thwart the People&#8217;s Bank of China&#8217;s efforts to reflate the economy,&#8221; Xu added. &#8220;Vehicle prices fell an annual 4.6%, which could suggest manufacturers are introducing deeper price cuts in the distribution and sales process.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chinese economy has released a selection of incentives to spur household spending, including reduced car loan rules. However, consumers are still cautious about making big purchases due to the slower economy and the weak job market.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would boost household income growth and meet consumer credit demand while slowing expansion in bloated industries.</p>
<p>Analysts are worried that credit is flowing more into production than consumption, which could reduce the effect of the central bank&#8217;s monetary policy tools. That will likely evolve with further weakness or deflationary issues, and stocks may decline again until further measures are taken.</p>
