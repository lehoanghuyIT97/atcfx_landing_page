										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some weaker economic data for the Chinese economy continues to weigh on the stock market. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50400" style="width: 771px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50400" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CHINA-50-Daily-Chart.png" alt="CHINA 50 - Daily Chart" width="771" height="538" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CHINA-50-Daily-Chart.png 771w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CHINA-50-Daily-Chart-300x209.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CHINA-50-Daily-Chart-768x536.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50400" class="wp-caption-text">CHINA 50 &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHINA 50 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has found some small resistance ahead of the 14,000 level but still trades in the familiar range from October. The 12,931 level is strong support for the market and the 14,359 level is the barrier to further highs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s economy displayed further weakness in April as President Donald Trump&#8217;s trade war hurt exports. Retail sales, property and investment data were all weaker than economists had forecast on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrial production also slowed as Trump&#8217;s high tariffs of up to 145%, and a 125% retaliatory duty from Beijing had an adverse effect. National Statistics Bureau spokesperson Fu Linghui said the overall trend was positive but said “external shocks” had gained intensity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It should also be noted that there are still many outside unstable and uncertain factors, and the foundation for the continued recovery and improvement of the national economy needs to be further consolidated,” Fu said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese consumers have held back on spending after the extended downturn in the housing market that is a big source of household wealth. Retail sales were 5.1% higher from a year ago, but below economists&#8217; expectations for a 6% gain. Deflationary threats are still in play with the consumer price index falling 0.1% in April.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current overall price level is low, which puts pressure on production and companies&#8217; operations and affects jobs and incomes, so it&#8217;s important to promote a reasonable recovery of prices,” Fu added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrial production rose by 6.1% from a year earlier, but was lower than the 7.7% seen in March as tariffs and other trade issues hurt exports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic data is light for the rest of the week but slower foreign inflows to stocks are another reason for the consolidation in stocks. Domestic investors have been piling into gold during April and that is also a weight on the stock volume.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese economy will have Caixin services PMI data released on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-47515 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CHI-50-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="CHI 50 - Weekly Chart" width="664" height="613" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CHI-50-Weekly-Chart.png 664w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CHI-50-Weekly-Chart-300x277.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CHI 50 &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHI50 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appears to be tracking global stocks lower with the support at 12,390-13,00 now crucial for the uptrend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The March Caixin Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in at 51.2 versus expectations of 50.6 and February’s 50.8. This is after Monday’s &#8220;official&#8221; survey also indicated stronger-than-expected growth in manufacturing in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US markets normally move on Chinese economic strength, but tariffs are having an effect on the outlook. Thursday now brings data from the services sector of the economy with a 51.6 reading expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese economy faces uncertain times as a huge 20% of its GDP is exports, and a trade shock will have a major impact. Factories are looking for new customers to sell their products, avoiding the US, but that could be hard with consumerism not booming overseas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest PMI data is a sign of an improving Chinese economy, boosted by the government’s stimulus, but that will now be hurt by the tariffs implemented. Any gains in China’s stock market recently have been driven by tech and not supporting other emerging markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s outperformance is “driven by a specific tech-driven boost to spending more towards the consumer away from investment, and it’s very unlikely to have large spillover impact to the rest of EM,” said Manik Narain, head of emerging-markets research at UBS Group in London. “This is not the classical Chinese playbook of 2009, 2016, 2020 that ultimately morphed into broader EM recoveries”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright spots have recently emerged in the economy but Trump’s trade wars risk hurting the recent gains.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CHI 50 – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHI 50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been trading in a range since October 2024 with support at 12,930 holding again. The upside target is 14,359.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrial production data is released at 10am HKT and analysts expect a dip from 6.2% to 5.3%. Retail sales data is released at the same time with economists expecting a gain from 3.7% to 4%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robin Xing, leading China economist at Morgan Stanley, recently discussed the outlook for the Chinese economy. He talked about Beijing&#8217;s focus on technological innovation and the recent stimulus packages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the September pivot on stimulus, the progress had been slow with deflationary pressures increasing since March. A debt-swap program for local governments and housing relief was followed by stimulus aimed at boosting consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s economy was on a stable path but growth and consumption was slow. Donald Trump’s tariffs were not a welcome addition but China has been expecting his arrival. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s approach to reforms and stimulus is to &#8220;establish the new before abolishing the old&#8221;, with a focus on gradual change in policy and expectation guidance. This has been a stance communicated in official documents since 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing believes that overseas investors have a new interest in Chinese assets that could be the start of global demand. Such a shift would boost Hong Kong as it acts as a cushion during geopolitical headwinds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the tariffs, many Chinese firms have operations in other markets that help them mitigate the impact. They are exporting more sophisticated products, such as cars, batteries, capital goods, and humanoid robots. This allows them to mitigate tariffs, given the value-added part of their goods is now higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CHI 50 is currently in a trading range with the support and resistance well defined for any breakout.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46215" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CHINA-50-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="CHINA 50 – Daily Chart" width="771" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CHINA-50-–-Daily-Chart.png 771w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CHINA-50-–-Daily-Chart-300x222.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CHINA-50-–-Daily-Chart-768x569.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CHINA 50 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China 50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been stuck in a range between around 12,930 and 14,359. The coming data could test either of those targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest data, released at 9:45am HKT on Monday will be another chance to get some movement above the 50 level. Last month’s 50.1 was just in expansionary mode but analysts see 50.3 ahead for February. However, any improvement for the month could be tainted by the tariff threat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump said two days ago that he planned to tax goods from China with a new 10% tariff. Imports from China already face a tax at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this year. China&#8217;s ministry of foreign affairs said it &#8220;strongly&#8221; communicated its &#8220;dissatisfaction and resolute opposition&#8221; to the plan. Trump also said he was moving forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to start on 4 March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The escalating tariffs put further pressure on China’s economy which has been unable to create real strength. The 5% GDP growth rate has been a bright spot but foreign investors have been slow to return, but that is likely coinciding with the AI-driven rally that powered companies like Nvidia and capital has remained in the domestic market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China said on Sunday that a meeting of high-level government bodies would lead to increased credit allocations to private, small and micro-enterprises and further streamlining of financing for private markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan Gongsheng, governor of the PBC, stated during the recent meeting that the central bank will provide financial institutions with further support to channel financial resources into the private economy, and implement a moderately loose monetary policy, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The financing costs for private enterprises are expected to remain at low levels for an extended period, thereby creating a favorable macro-monetary and financial environment for their development,&#8221; Pan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further efforts to support the economy can help with the looming tariffs and manufacturing data on Monday is a near-term catalyst. China daily noted that the economy hit a record in 2024 and said Western media has a fixation with economic doom narratives for China.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CHI50 – Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHI50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has failed to get above the downtrend support and that level is vital for Monday’s data release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese NBS manufacturing is released at 9:30am HKT with market watchers expecting a reading of 50.1. The 50 level is the difference between expansion and contraction and will be important for the market’s path this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the figures, investors are still wary of the coming actions on tariffs from Donald Trump. The new US President said he was considering a new 10% tariff on Chinese imports from as early as February 1. Trump also proposed new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beijing said last week that it was “firmly committed to safeguarding national interests”. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning added that, “there are no winners in a trade or a tariff war”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors have been soothed by the early inaction from Trump on tariffs and he said that the two nations can have a “very good relationship” in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“China realizes that there&#8217;s an opportunity to negotiate with Trump,” said Liu Dongshu of the City University of Hong Kong. “And a better US-China relationship is more important to China than to the United States”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shanghai Composite is in need of a new boost after the 2024 stimulus rally faded. A manufacturing boost would help ahead of the Chinese New Year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slow start to the year for the Shanghai Composite index has the potential to change with recent buying. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44958" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CHINA-50-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="CHINA 50 – Daily Chart" width="724" height="570" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CHINA-50-–-Daily-Chart.png 724w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CHINA-50-–-Daily-Chart-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CHINA 50 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHINA 50 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has set a base below key support and is set to move higher if it can clear the 13,000 level. That could target the 13,600 and 14,400 levels in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many retail investors in China helped to drive an early January slump with the top Chinese index marking its worst start to a year for a decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets had ample time to process the coming policies of Donald Trump and nothing new has driven the recent slump. Markets have been unhappy with the level of Chinese stimulus and maybe looking for more. However, the government may look to release new plans around the Chinese Lunar new year and boost sentiment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese stocks saw their first annual gain in 2024 after a three-year decline, driven by the pandemic lockdowns, property woes and a weak consumer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail money makes up roughly 70% of China&#8217;s share trading, which is why a sell-off could trigger a sharp unwind of leveraged bets and losses which could hurt Beijing&#8217;s moves to boost markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government needs a strong bull market to fund economic revival but another boom-and-bust would &#8220;destroy wealth, hurt consumption and harm China&#8217;s economy&#8221;, said Dong Baozhen at Beijing’s Lingtong Shengtai. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts are worried that another sell-off would be another drag on retail investor confidence who have already shown pessimism with weak consumer spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent institutional behaviour saw  hedge funds raise exposure to China during last year&#8217;s stimulus-led rally but soon backed off and global long-only funds &#8220;have stayed largely on the sideline&#8221;, Goldman Sachs said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with the market getting above the lower level support, it could be that we are setting up the next rebound and retail investors are often late to the party. The December Caixin Services PMI accelerated month over month to 52.2 from November’s 51.5. Mainland investors snapped up Hong Kong shares this week with over $6 billion worth of net buying via Stock Connect.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44311" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/China-50-Daily-Chart.png" alt="China 50 - Daily Chart" width="814" height="667" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/China-50-Daily-Chart.png 814w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/China-50-Daily-Chart-300x246.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/China-50-Daily-Chart-768x629.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">China 50 &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China 50 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been trading in a range since October after the stimulus-led rally led to selling. The range is now in place between 12,931 and 14,539 for the index.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Bureau of Statistics will release manufacturing figures at 9:30am. The index is expected to come in at 50.3, which is just above the expansionary 50 level. A stronger number could give stocks a year-end boost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulus policies implemented by the Chinese government since September have shown the government’s commitment to promote stability and global economic growth. There have been some positive signs from the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) earlier this month, showing momentum and resilience in the domestic economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policies, which included tax reductions, large-scale equipment upgrades and trade-in programs for consumer goods, have created positive momentum. The Ministry of Commerce said in December that sales revenue of consumer goods under the trade-in program, in which old consumer items are exchanged for upgraded ones, surpassed one trillion RMB. Passenger vehicle sales under the trade-in program alone was more than five million units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign banks are growing bullish on the Chinese market. Desmond Kuang, CIO for China at HSBC Global Private Banking and Wealth, said the policies have boosted manufacturers&#8217; morale as both supply and demand recovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s resilience is also tied to its outstanding supply chain advantage, ensuring the country keeps a dominant position in the global industrial chain. The stock market has cooled from a steep rally into October but overseas investors may see an opportunity to grab stocks at cheap valuations compared to the US.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese stock market investors are looking to the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) for its next interest rate moves on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43162" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CHINA-50-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="CHINA 50 - Daily Chart" width="918" height="618" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CHINA-50-Daily-Chart-1.png 918w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CHINA-50-Daily-Chart-1-300x202.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CHINA-50-Daily-Chart-1-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CHINA 50 &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China 50 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has some support in play after the recent pullback. The 13,000 level is key for the index this week and could reignite the rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PBoC’s latest interest rate decision will be announced on Wednesday at 9:15am HKT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese government is still seeking to stimulate the economy and regulators reportedly asked the country&#8217;s banks to lower rates they pay to deposits from other financial institutions. The country’s interest rate mechanism, a supervisory body overseen by the central bank, said banks should lower the interbank deposit rate against the 7-day reverse repo rate, currently set at 1.5% annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Reuters survey of 28 participants, all respondents expected rates on the one-year and five-year LPRs to remain at the same level.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;LPRs were lowered so sharply in October, so it is unlikely to have another cut this month,&#8221; a Chinese bank trader told Reuters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors will look for the government’s response to the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/trump-vs-harris-election-market-impact-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threat of tariffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the incoming Trump government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aside from the tariff threat, the recent upward repricing of US rates is surely causing some headaches in Beijing, as it limits space for monetary easing in China at a time when the economy is trying to get back on its feet,&#8221; said Roman Ziruk, senior analyst at Ebury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The index of the top 50 Chinese shares has support around the 13,000 level and that will be key to keeping the rally alive into year-end.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CHINA 50 &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the CHINA 50 has bounced near 13,000 and now is looking to confirm a double bottom pattern. That level will be critical in the week ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s manufacturing activity in October expanded for the first time in six months, according to official data on Thursday, supporting policymakers&#8217; optimism that recent stimulus will get the world&#8217;s number two economy back on track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official purchasing managers&#8217; index (PMI) rose to 50.1 in October from 49.8 in September, just above the 50 level, which marks expansion, ahead of a median forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 50.1 level is the smallest possible expansion for the PMI but nonetheless bucks expectations for continued contraction, and is a positive sign that the small bounce back of industrial production that we saw in September could continue,” said Lynn Song of ING Economics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Song added that subindices showed signs there could be a “gradual improvement” in the economy. The production subindex hit a six-month high of 52, and new orders returned to a reading of 50 after five months of contraction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data offers some hope that the Chinese government stimulus is making its way into the right places and boosting confidence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andres Rincon, Head of ETF Sales and Strategy at TD Securities, said China could be set for further </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment flows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen, just since the announcement, about $6 billion go into this space,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re seeing a lot more money going to this space. And I think it&#8217;s more about people that have been underweight in this space because of the risks in this space. They&#8217;ve taken this as an opportunity to basically go probably market weight. And this is obviously what&#8217;s driving a big part of the flows”.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We noted the recent rally in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China 50 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and broader market but it is interesting to see news outlets in the west doubting the move. It is actually a rally from oversold levels that can continue higher.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41357" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CHINA-50-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="CHINA 50 - Weekly Chart" width="721" height="634" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CHINA-50-Weekly-Chart.png 721w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CHINA-50-Weekly-Chart-300x264.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CHINA 50 &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even on a visual basis with the weekly chart, we can see that the index of the top 50 Chinese stocks based around the 11,000 level on three occasions since 2022. The market is not close to the 2021 high above 20,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An article from US-based outlet CNBC said that the recent rally “has echoes of the 2015 bubble”. Another from Forbes said that “China’s 30% Stock Rally Has An Economic Problem”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those types of articles fail to note that the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States stock market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been rallying to all-time highs on the promise of AI gains that have failed to materialise yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quick example is Alibaba stock, which now trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 1.86x. That is still 51% lower than the 5-year average of 3.79x. The company’s US peer Amazon trades at 3.08x sales and both companies have interests in artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A disappointing recovery in the Chinese economy led to slow foreign investment in domestic firms but Western investors could miss out on future gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg reported that Invesco said that “Some stocks have become really overvalued”. Other investment banks are urging caution but will happily sell US stocks at the top of their recent valuations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether the sweeping moves will rescue the nation’s deeply distressed real estate sector and ease consumer malaise is uncertain,” said Gina Adams at Bloomberg Intelligence. “China’s late-week moves have yet to lift the broader earnings outlook for emerging markets for 2024 or 2025 as analysts and investors gauge the impact”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent move in China is based on the government finally drawing a line in the sand and committing to stimulus. As overseas investors focus on the recent economic issues, stocks can return to a healthier valuation and are far from a bubble.</span></p>
