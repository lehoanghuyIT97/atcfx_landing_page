<p style="text-align: center">HSI – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The Hang Seng has been testing a key level from 2022 over the last two weeks, which provides weekly resistance. A strong weekly gain above 16,842-17,000 could see the index power higher to the downtrend resistance at 18,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/hk-share-cfd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hong Kong stocks</a> were boosted by a leadership change at Alibaba to strengthen its e-commerce business. After the company reshuffled its executives, Alibaba climbed to the highest level since November. According to an internal memo, PDD Holdings continued to attack its market share.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reshuffle is aimed at finding new growth driver for its e-commerce business that&#8217;s been battered by rivals including from live-streaming platforms,&#8221; said Dai Ming at Huichen Asset Management. &#8220;On the other hand, Alibaba may also start to adjust its sprawling investment portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hong Kong traders also have to consider the path of the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/us-dollar-economic-data-fed-driven-slump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US dollar after the Federal Reserve hinted at rate cuts</a> as the following likely path. That has spurred record levels in the Nasdaq and <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/dow-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones</a>, with the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> only 0.60% away.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng also got support from Chinese economic numbers, showing that the economy was turning. In a report, the National Bureau of Statistics said that the country&#8217;s retail sales rose 10.1% in November. The country&#8217;s unemployment rate remained at 5.0% while industrial production rose by 6.6%, marking the fastest growth over two years. The industrial production outpaced the median estimate of 5.6%.</p>
<p>A strong weekly close this week could lead to a follow-through rally into year-end and set the stage for 2024 gains.</p>
