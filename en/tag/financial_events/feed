										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Non-Farm Payroll report (NFP) is the US employment report released monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It tracks employment trends for the US workers employed in the construction, manufacturing, and services sectors.</p>
<p>The NFP report tracks about 98% of the overall US workforce and excludes workers who are employed on farms as well as those working in private households, government agencies, and non-profit employees. The BLS labour market report shows how many jobs were created in the past month and covers statistics on earnings and hours worked.</p>
<p>As it is technically impossible to survey the entire <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/trump-economic-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Economy</a> each month, the BLS conducts the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, which includes a sample of approximately 119,000 businesses and government agencies covering about 629,000 individual worksites. This sample amounts to one-third of all the US NFP employees.</p>
<h2>Non-Farm Payroll 2025 Release Dates | NFP 2025 Timeline</h2>
<p>For 2025, upcoming US Non-Farm Release Payroll dates are listed here, and as always stands to rock <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forex</a> traders, and stock market traders alike.</p>
<h3>Time-Zone Information &amp; GMT Conversion</h3>
<p>The Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report is released at 8:30 AM Eastern Time (ET), but the corresponding Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) equivalent varies based on whether Eastern Standard Time (EST) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is in effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eastern Standard Time (EST) is UTC−05:00 and is observed during standard time (late autumn/winter in the United States and Canada).</li>
<li>Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is UTC−04:00 and is observed during daylight saving time (spring/summer in the United States and Canada).</li>
<li>GMT+8 and GMT+7 Conversions:
<ul>
<li>During EST (UTC−5) → The equivalent local time in GMT+8 regions (e.g., Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing) is 8:30 PM.</li>
<li>During EDT (UTC−4) → The equivalent local time in GMT+7 regions (e.g., Bangkok, Jakarta, Vietnam) is 7:30 PM.</li>

<h2>Why is the Non-Farm Payroll report so important?</h2>
<p>Watch Our Video for a Quick Introduction to Non Farm Payroll (NFP)!</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRLLHZkHeh0?si=qpNeIDn4xHTgl0I8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Traders and analysts place a high importance on the NFP because it is a summary of the state of the US labour market. This is extremely valuable to forex and <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stock market</a> traders because the Federal Reserve (FED) considers the US employment situation a significant factor when setting interest rates. Also, the NFP change correlates well with annual GDP growth. The benefit of the NFP report is that it is released each month, while the GDP report is published quarterly with at least one month’s lag, thus the NFP report acts as a proxy for GDP.</p>
<p>The fact that the US is the leading economy in the world means that the condition of the US labour market is a sign of the condition of most advanced economies. The US is also the biggest consumer market in the world, and the health of the US economy impacts many other countries that trade with the US.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Federal Reserve (FED) is paying attention to the flow of new jobs into the US economic system and their mutual effect on the US unemployment rate, for the net contribution may be significant in influencing the employment and unemployment rates.</p>
<p>Unemployment has a direct ripple effect on future inflation. Job creation in the economy generally has positive inflationary effects because individuals with increased spending power have more to buy (i.e., they tend to shop more). In contrast, unemployment has a deflationary impact on the economy. After all, individuals with limited purchasing power tend to spend less (i.e., shop less).</p>
<p>Therefore, the Federal Open Market Committee (<a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/audusd-fomc-minutes-employment-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOMC</a>) usually considers rate hikes whenever jobs grow quickly and unemployment is low. In contrast, they consider rate cuts whenever there are widespread job reductions. The NFP report also offers insight into wage changes, another form of inflation. If they indicate an inflation increase by wage increase, the dollar values and the stock market will trend upward.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, the Federal Reserve, and FOMC must strike a balance between the unemployment rate and inflation. The ambition is to have a low unemployment rate and an annual inflation rate of two percent.</p>
<h2>How Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) Impacts on Forex and Stocks</h2>
<p>As a leading indicator of the US GDP report, the NFP report influences trader sentiment toward the dollar. A strong NFP report may lead traders to buy or hold the dollar, anticipating economic growth. Conversely, if the jobs market disappoints, traders are likely to sell the dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stock market will take a more intricate view of the report, but a strong number of jobs added will be bullish. More people employed means that more people are getting paid. That will ultimately find its way into the economy and generate more profit for businesses.</p>

<h2>Non-farm payroll components</h2>
<p>The Non Farm Payroll (NFP) report is one of the most closely monitored economic indicators and provides important insights into the health of the US economy. It tracks employment trends in key industries such as construction, manufacturing and services, but excludes farm workers, private household employees, government agencies and non-profit workers. Here’s a breakdown of its key components and their importance:</p>
<h3>1. Headline NFP Figure</h3>
<p>NFP&#8217;s headline data reveals the number of jobs created or lost in the previous month. This statistic is particularly important because it reflects the overall state of the labour market. During periods of economic growth, the figure is typically positive, while recessions often produce negative numbers. The headline figure can be volatile, with economists sometimes underestimating or overestimating the outcome. This unpredictability creates trading opportunities, especially for short-term traders.</p>
<h3>2. Unemployment Rate (U3)</h3>
<p>The U3 indicator shows the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively looking for work. While U3 is the official and most commonly cited number, and also not to be ignored, broader measures such as U6 (which includes discouraged workers and underemployed individuals) can provide more context. These rates are also critical for gauging economic weakness and guiding the Federal Reserve (Fed)&#8217;s monetary policy decisions.</p>
<h3>3. Sectoral Breakdown</h3>
<p>The NFP report also provides details on which sectors gained and lost jobs. For example: A decline in manufacturing or technology jobs could signal challenges in specific industries, affecting the stock prices of companies operating in those industries. Traders and investors who follow these news can use the data to make industry-specific investment decisions and align their portfolios with emerging trends.</p>
<h3>4. Average Hourly Earnings</h3>
<p>Average hourly earnings provide insightful data on a tight or soft labour market. For example: Rising wages often indicate a tightening labour market, which can push up inflation. However, if wage growth is concentrated in low-wage sectors, the impact on inflationary pressures may be limited. The FED pays close attention to this indicator when setting <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-fed-rate-hikes-affect-stock-forex-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interest Rate Policy</a>.</p>
<h2>Trading the Non Farm Payroll Report</h2>
<p>The NFP report is a key driver of market volatility, and both long-term and short-term traders have the opportunity to benefit from it:</p>
<p>Long-Term Traders: Focus on the report’s broader economic and FED policy implications. They analyze and adjust investment portfolios based on the report&#8217;s impact on industry and overall market conditions.</p>
<p>Short-Term Traders: Take advantage of the immediate impact before and after the report is released to predict and execute transactions based on dramatic price changes. Understanding market expectations and deviations from actual numbers is critical.</p>
<h2>How economists’ forecasts are arrived at</h2>
<p>News organizations like Bloomberg and Reuters compile estimates from 80 to 100 economists and analysts from banks and research firms. The median estimate represents the midpoint of forecasts and serves as a market benchmark. For instance, the market will react more strongly when the actual NFP data deviates significantly from this estimate. For example, the NFP data that exceeds expectations may reveal economic development and forex rate appreciation, while lower-than-expected NFP could indicate economic slowdown, resulting in market correction.</p>
<h2>Why It’s Important to Stay Updated</h2>
<p>The NFP report affects personal trading strategies and serves as a bellwether for broader economic trends. By staying updated with the latest data and knowing its implications, traders have the opportunity to make informed decisions, manage risk, enhance profit potential, and identify both short-and long-term trading opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="line-height: 2">What Is The OPEC Meeting?</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">The OPEC meeting is the bi-annual meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC is one of the most important groups in the world due to oil’s importance to the global economy.</p>
<p><span id="more-10400"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The most important part of the meeting involves the setting of production quotas. Each member is allocated a production target and the combined production level is meant to keep oil prices in a target range.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">From a trader’s perspective, comments leading up to the meeting and actual decisions at the meetings are important drivers for crude oil prices. There are two meetings per year, but an emergency meeting could be called in rare cases.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">OPEC was founded in 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. Since 1965, the group has been headquartered in Vienna, Austria and has grown to 14 member countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">As of 2018, OPEC accounted for 44% of the world’s crude oil production, and they had control of 81.5% of the world’s proven oil reserves according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Oil has been a volatile commodity and in 2014, an oil glut caused prices to collapse from around $113 per barrel to around $25 over a period of months. Slowing Chinese growth and a ramp up in US production due to new shale technologies were the cause. Oil slowly recovered with the help of OPEC and then crashed again due to the pandemic in 2020.&nbsp;OPEC has since tried to balance the production and income needs of countries with slowing global growth.</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 2">When Is The Next OPEC Announcement?</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">At the time of writing, the most recent OPEC meeting was held on October 5, 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The next meeting will likely take place around April 2023.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 2">How Does OPEC Affect Crude Oil Traders?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2">Each month, OPEC will publish figures on crude oil production by its members, traders use this to get an understanding if supply is increasing or decreasing. Large swings might influence crude oil prices if production is too large or too low compared with their predetermined crude oil production targets.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">However, more importantly, in the OPEC meeting, the members will share their future crude oil production targets.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 2">How Does OPEC Change The Oil Price &amp; Oil Production?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2">OPEC will indirectly control crude oil prices by altering their crude oil production. If demand remains the same, but they lower their production, then crude oil prices should increase. While, if they increase supply, and demand remains the same, crude oil prices should decline.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">OPEC cannot control demand, but they make assumptions about it and try to produce crude oil in a manner that keeps prices at a favourable price for its members, without causing too much trouble for its buyers. They are aware that if they keep prices too high that large oil consumers will try to shift away from crude oil.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">In the past, OPEC had a large control over crude oil prices, but the increased production of shale oil in the US led to decreased dominance for OPEC.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 2">How Has OPEC Affected Crude Oil Prices In The Past?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2">Following the Yom Kippur War, in October 1973, OPEC decided to reduce their production significantly and to introduce an oil embargo against the US and other nations that supported Israel in the war. OPEC’s action caused a large spike in crude oil prices, and they traded from 3 dollars per barrel to 12 dollars. In the US, energy rationing was introduced, and in the UK the work week was cut from five days to three days, while in seven European countries, non-important Sunday driving was banned.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/oil%20opec.webp" alt="oil opec" width="713" height="401" loading="lazy" style="height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 713px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"></p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The oil embargo ended in March 1974, but prices remained high, and it led to a global economic recession, high unemployment rate and inflation.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">By 1980 crude oil prices had reached a high of 40 dollars per barrel following the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war. As prices were high, industrialised countries made efforts to switch away from crude oil usage, and exploration by non-OPEC countries was ramped up. As an effect, crude oil demand declined, and total world crude production increased, this caused crude oil prices to plunge.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">To try to stabilise the price, OPEC in 1982 introduced audited national quotas. However, this failed as some members did not comply. Saudi Arabia did its best to cut its production and did so by 66% from 1981 to 1985, but this did not help to boost crude oil prices. Instead, they ramped up production to cause crude oil prices to plunge below 10 dollars per barrel, and thereby make high costs production outside of Saudi Arabia to suffer.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The most recent episode of heavy OPEC intervention was from 2014 to 2018. From 2008 to 2016 US crude oil production doubled, as shale oil production made it more feasible to produce crude oil in the US.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Over the same period, OPEC members consistently produced more oil, and the Chinese economy was slowing down, and requiring less crude oil. From its 2014 highs of $115 per barrel, prices slumped by 89% to their 2016 low of $27.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">It took time for the prices to regain their footing, as Saudi Arabia was applying the same strategy of the 1980s to drive out high-cost producers. As the low crude oil prices started to tire out OPEC members and drive out high-cost producers, OPEC began to reduce their production in 2016, to ramp up the cuts in 2017 and 2018. Oil went on another rollercoaster ride in 2020 as the pandemic arrived. Prices fell from $60 to the low single digits, before beginning a rally to $120.</p>

<p><span id="more-10377"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The overall aim is to select a base rate that allows the economy to grow without fuelling excess speculation. The central bank holds the view that inflation should be maintained at 2%.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Before the MPC announcement, meetings undergo a three-day period. The MPC meetings are held eight times throughout the year. It starts with a briefing from Bank of England staff, and then during the meetings, the economic data are discussed as well as what policies need implementing. On the third day the committee votes and on the following Thursday, the interest rates are published at noon. The committee also creates an inflation report after every other meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 2;text-align: center">When is the next MPC interest rate announcement?</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">The next announcement is scheduled to be on Thursday 15<sup>th</sup> of December 2022. The minutes from the meeting are released on the same day.</p>

<h3 style="line-height: 2.5">Why is the MPC meeting important to traders?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2">The MPC meetings are significant for traders as they set the UK’s interest rates and monetary policy. The base rate determines how much money commercial banks can borrow from the Bank of England. It also has an effect on the mortgage market and the savings of the public.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Since the financial crisis of 2008, central banks have also adopted quantitative Easing (QE). QE is a strategy implemented by the Bank of England and involves injecting money into the economy in order to encourage and boost spending. This was used during two further crises- the European debt crisis of 2015, and the pandemic in 2020.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Therefore, the MPC meetings can impact the way traders manage and adapt their investment strategies and portfolio in reaction to the policy decisions. If there was a hike in interest rates this would have various effects such as an increase in the cost of borrowing, an increase in mortgage interest payments, saving rather than spending, and an increase in government debts. The value of the currency is likely to increase as well in relation to the rates of other nations. Lowering the interest rate will have the opposite effect of this.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 2">How does the MPC influence inflation in the UK?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2">There are two policy tools that the MPC uses to influence the rate of inflation in the country. This is the Bank of England Base Rate (BOEBR) and the asset purchase facility (APF).</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 2;text-align: right">What is the Bank of England Base Rate?</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">The base rate is the official interest rate charged by the Bank of England to commercial banks for overnight loans. The rate also affects the long-term and short-term interest charged by commercial banks. Therefore, it is the base rate for the economy in the UK.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">So how does it work? Well, if the Bank of England lowers the base rate, then banks may need to borrow from the Bank of England, and as an effect lower their interest rates. In turn, consumers and businesses will be able to borrow and spend more because the cost of borrowing is now lower.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">On the other hand, if the rate has been increased, banks will have to increase their rates as borrowing money from the Bank of England may not be an option. In this case, borrowing becomes more expensive for consumers and businesses as the cost of capital has increased.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The base rate was also used as a tool during the recession in 2008. The Bank of England lowered its base rate to 0.5% in a bid to encourage economic recovery. The lower interest rate meant it was cheaper for both consumers and businesses to borrow money, which in turn encouraged spending and investing. However, there is a limit to how much rates can be reduced.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 2">Asset Purchase Facility</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">Quantitative Easing is a way of injecting money into the economy, and this is generally done by electronically creating new money. This is then used to buy government debt in the form of bonds, another name for this is asset purchases. The large-scale purchases of these bonds lower the interest rate on the bond (also known as yields). The purchases of these bonds will push down the interest rate offered on loans, such as business loans. This is because rates on government bonds normally affect other interest rates in the economy. The BoE targets a particular bond in the market to protect it from market forces and this can help the balance sheets of banks or other institutions that are vulnerable to higher borrowing costs.</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 2">Members of the MPC</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">There are five members of the Bank of England who make up the MPC. The governor, three deputy governors, and the chief economist. There are also four economic experts appointed by the chancellor of the exchequer. One vote is allowed for each member and the governor votes last, in the event of a stalemate. The members are replaced or reappointed after they serve a fixed term.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Market analysts tend to make predictions on the result of the meetings based on the members and the economic stance that they take. Analysts classify them as monetary hawks and doves.</p>
<h4 style="line-height: 2;padding-left: 40px">Hawks</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><span data-hs-icon-hubl="true">{% icon icon_set=&#8221;fontawesome-5.14.0&#8243; name=&#8221;Alternate Long Arrow Right&#8221; style=&#8221;SOLID&#8221; height=&#8221;18&#8243; purpose=&#8221;decorative&#8221; title=&#8221;Alternate Long Arrow Right icon&#8221; %}</span>A hawk is someone who prefers market forces to dictate prices.</p>
<h4 style="line-height: 2;padding-left: 40px">Doves</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><span data-hs-icon-hubl="true">{% icon icon_set=&#8221;fontawesome-5.14.0&#8243; name=&#8221;Alternate Long Arrow Right&#8221; style=&#8221;SOLID&#8221; height=&#8221;18&#8243; purpose=&#8221;decorative&#8221; title=&#8221;Alternate Long Arrow Right icon&#8221; %}</span>A dove is someone who takes the opposite stance and believes monetary policy should be supportive of the economy and its institutions.</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 2">History of the MPC</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">The committee was created after the 1997 general election to be independent of political interference. The committee was then given the responsibility of setting interest rates by following the Bank of England Act 1998. This form of operational responsibility was granted to the committee by the chancellor of the exchequer at the time, Gordon Brown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting?</h2>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is a regular session held by members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve (FED). At the FOMC meeting, its members vote on the future of US monetary policy. Typically, they will set the discount rate, which is the interest rate at which US banks can borrow money from the Federal Reserve. The FED has the power to lend and print an unlimited amount of money, therefore the discount rate it sets becomes a benchmark for all banks. If the interest rate of all other banks is higher than the discount rate then a bank can borrow money from the central banks at the discount rate, instead of borrowing from its peers. This means the FED funds rate, which is the rate at which banks charge each other, does not deviate too much from the discount rate. During the FOMC meeting, decisions are also made on quantitative easing or quantitative tightening programs. These programs are where the FED buys and sells government bonds.</p>
<p><span id="more-10363"></span></p>
<h2>When is the next FED meeting?</h2>
<p>The next meeting will take place on June 18-19, with any policy changes announced on June 19, 2019. From 2019, the FOMC publishes a statement as well as holding a press conference, to answer questions from the media.</p>

<h3>How does the FOMC meeting affect markets?</h3>
<p>On the second day of each rate meeting, the FOMC shares its view on the US economy and addresses any possible changes to the US monetary policy. The central bank&#8217;s tries to influence the state of the US economy and its inflation path via interest rates and quantitative easing or tightening programs.</p>
<p>However, in the immediate future, decisions will be taken on short-term interest rates. This normally has a direct impact on bonds, Forex, and stock indices.</p>
<p>Forex: the overnight charges (swap rates) that you receive or are charged by your broker, are typically based on a three month LIBOR rate, which is directly affected by any actual and anticipated changes to the discount rate.</p>
<p>In short, an increase in the FED funds rates tends to strengthen the US Dollar, as investors and traders are now paid higher interest rates by holding dollars. However, if the FOMC decides to lower interest rates or introduce quantitative easing, the dollar tends to soften, as the discount rate is now lower.</p>
<p>Stock market indices, such as the S&amp;P 500, will at times react strongly to the FED’s actions, depending on the state of the economy. A critical time is when the economy is running hot, and the Fed aggressively increases interest rates to combat the economy from overheating. Another critical time is when the economy is heading towards a recession, and the economy needs lower rates to return to growth. The FOMC decisions influence interest rates and bond rates, and in the long run, they tend to affect the real economy as higher interest rates will make mortgages, credit card spending, auto loans, and student loans more expensive and vice versa. For the stock market, it increases corporate borrowing and debt servicing costs.</p>
<h2>What is the Federal Funds rate?</h2>
<p>The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which participating banks of the FED system lend to other depository institutions overnight. The banks set this rate and it depends entirely on supply and demand. However, it will not deviate much from the FED discount rate as it acts as a substitution. In other words, if the federal funds rate is too high then a participating bank can borrow money from the FED. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate for loans overnight, much like the discount rate.</p>
<h2>What is Federal Reserve Quantitative Easing?</h2>
<p>In the last decade,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Quantitative easing</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(QE) was an extra measure introduced by the Federal Reserve, as the discount rate was about to reach the zero bound and the FED was not ready to impose negative interest rates to boost lending. But the zero-bound discount rate was just one part of the problem. As the discount rate is a short-term interest rate, it will influence short-term lending between banks, and not have a direct impact on longer-term bond rates, such as the US ten-year government bond yield or the 30-year mortgage rates of homeowners. Instead, QE was introduced, to allow the Federal Reserve to buy an unlimited amount of bonds on the secondary market to artificially lower interest rates, where they were deemed as most necessary. During the financial crisis of 2008. The Fed’s balance sheet more than doubled to reflect these bond holdings. It doubled again during the 2015 European debt crisis. A tapering of assets to unwind some of the holdings began in 2017 but was halted abruptly due to the pandemic. The Federal Reserve balance sheet was almost nine trillion dollars in 2022- 900% higher than the level in 2008.</p>

<h3>FED Meeting Dates</h3>
<p>The FOMC meets eight times a year, but in rare cases, they can also arrange an emergency meeting. Policy changes are announced at the end of each meeting, and starting in 2019, a televised press release follows each meeting. The televised press release offers additional insights behind the thinking of the FED, as journalists are given the opportunity to ask questions. The minutes of each FOMC board meeting are made available to the public three weeks after the FED meeting.</p>
<h2>History of the FOMC</h2>
<p>In 1913, the Federal Reserve was made up of twelve geographical districts, each with its own Reserve Bank. The locations were based on the prevailing trade regions that existed in 1913, and don’t coincide with current state lines. The original idea was that each Reserve bank would independently set a discount rate to serve each region best. However, by 1933 and 1935 the US economy was so integrated that the FOMC was born. The FOMC has since decided on the discount rate for the whole country.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee is made up of seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and these members are appointed by the US president, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Fed presidents.</p>
<h5>Doves and Hawks</h5>
<p>The chair of the Federal Reserve, currently Jerome Powell, is the most important member of the FOMC. Powell’s views tend to be centrist in relation to the views of the other Fed and FOMC members. Members are then classified as “doves” or “hawks.” Hawks are more supportive of market forces and tighter monetary conditions. Doves, on the other hand, prefer having low-interest rates and stimulus measures to support the labour market and the economy. The relationship between hawks and doves is widely followed in between each meeting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is the European Central Bank (ECB) Meeting?</h2>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) meeting is known as the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting and is held every six weeks. Decisions regarding monetary policies and interest rates are made at the meeting, and changes tend to have a major impact on the world’s most popular currency pair: the EURUSD, which is the Euro vs. USD exchange rate. Other Euro-dominated pairs such as EURGBP, and EURCAD, EURAUD, tend to see large price swings on the day of the ECB rate meeting.</p>
<p><span id="more-10349"></span></p>
<p>For the ECB the main objective is to maintain stable prices (inflation) for the countries that use the Euro. Decisions made by the council are announced on the day of the meeting at 12.45 pm CET, this is done through a press release. Following this, there is a press conference on the day of the meeting, allowing the media to ask questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why is the ECB important?</h2>
<p>Traders and investors try to predict the outcome of the monetary policy meetings in order to position their portfolios or capitalise on short-term moves. If interest rates go up aggressively over shorter periods, traders can expect a ripple effect that decreases the value of stocks, bonds, and other securities. It tends, however, to increase the value of the Euro to other currencies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lower interest rates could have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>To predict future monetary policies, traders examine the formation of the Governing Council, the distribution of voting rights between countries, and look at economic factors such as economic growth and inflation, and political decisions such as Brexit. Members of the governing council’s executive board make regular speeches and appearances at conferences where they can reveal some key thoughts on the current market and policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How does the ECB meeting affect financial markets?</h3>
<p>The ECB meeting aims to set an inflation rate across the EU area of just under 2%. The meetings are highly significant for traders as it determines the official interest rates for the eurozone. Once the rates have been set, the national central banks (NCBs) are required by the ECB to use the rates for transactions with commercial banks.</p>
<p>There are key rates that are set, these include the minimum bid rate, the deposit rate, and the marginal lending rate.</p>
<p>The minimum bid rate is the rate set for one-week loans only.</p>
<p>Deposit rates are the rates paid on deposits that have been held with NCBs.</p>
<p>The marginal lending rate is only for overnight loans.</p>
<p>The Governing Council also could apply something called quantitative easing (QE) when it is required. QE involves putting money into the economy to boost and encourage spending. The policies set by the ECB influence the interest rates set by commercial banks and other lenders.</p>
<p>Therefore traders and investors are likely to be concerned about the impact the ECB policy will have on the demand for stocks and other securities. This may cause traders to change their strategies. It is common for traders to predict which way the monetary policy will be heading, before each meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How does the ECB impact the forex market?</h3>
<p>Traders look for either Hawkish or Dovish language to determine whether the ECB will increase or decrease the rates. They will look for clues in the language used by the chairman of the ECB, and other members, outside of the meetings, these clues can be referred to as ‘forward guidance’.</p>
<h4>Hawkish</h4>
<p>The term Hawkish is used if central bankers are talking about tightening monetary policy. The policy is tightened by increasing interest rates or even reducing the ECB’s bank’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>Central bankers tend to be hawkish if the economic outlook is positive and if inflation is expected to rise. If a central bank is hawkish it means that the economy and its financial products can stand strong in the free market and not come under selling pressure.</p>
<h4>Dovish</h4>
<p>If Central bankers are talking about reducing interest rates or even introducing quantitative easing (injecting money into the economy) then they are said to be dovish. Dovish members are said to support accommodative monetary policy, which means that they are buffering the economy from market forces.</p>
<p>European bonds are attractive if traders think that the ECB will commence an interest rate hiking cycle. The demand for those bonds then adds support for the euro currency. If traders believe that the ECB will support a dovish stance, then the euro will likely depreciate. The yield difference between two countries is called the interest rate yield differential.</p>
<p>Before the 2008 financial crisis, traders were heavily-involved in carry trades, where they borrowed very low-interest rate currencies like the Japanese yen to fund trades in higher-yielding currencies like the Australian dollar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is the ECB independent?</h2>
<p>The independence of the ECB is significant to maintain price stability. Central banks have tried to separate monetary policy from direct political influence, as they haven’t always been independent bodies. The danger with governments having control over central banks is that politicians may be tempted to force short-term decisions that are not beneficial in the long run.</p>
<h3>A closer look at the ECB rate decisions</h3>
<p>The way inflation is controlled by the Governing Council is by changing the key European interest rates.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold">minimum bid rate</span>: This is the rate the NCBs must charge for one-week loans. There are two names for this, the main refinancing rate or the ECB refi rate. Commercial banks use the minimum rate as it is the lowest rate on which they can borrow capital. The rate also has a significant influence on the interest rates charged by commercial banks to businesses and consumers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Deposit Rate</span>: This is the amount of interest paid on overnight deposits that are made with NCBs in the Eurosystem. If the deposit rate is increased this means that commercial banks will get a better return on money deposited with the NCBs.</p>
<p>Therefore, commercial banks can give fewer overnight loans to other commercial banks. If the deposit rate goes down, then banks will get a lower return than the amount they deposited with the NCBs. Commercial banks will then want to provide more overnight loans and deposit less money. The deposit rate is another way the Governing council controls the cash flow into the economy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marginal lending rate</span>: This lending rate is the rate that NCBS must follow to charge commercial banks for overnight loans. These loans are used by banks to ensure that they have enough cash for clients, this is so that the loan will meet the bank’s reserve requirements for the day. Therefore, the ECB will set this rate higher than the minimum bid rate, this is seen as a penalty for banks that have to borrow emergency funds to meet their reserve requirements.</p>
<p>The penalty is greater when there is a wider gap between the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate. The gap can also be called the corridor. This affects the way conservative banks are with their capital and their willingness to provide loans to both commercial and retail clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is the ECB&#8217;s asset purchasing programme?</h2>
<p>The asset purchase program, also known as Quantitative Easing (QE), was first introduced in 2015. This was created during the Eurozone debt crisis as a method to stabilise the yields on government debts in countries such as Greece.</p>
<p>The ECB spent four years purchasing asset-backed securities, covered bonds, and government and corporate debt. This also benefited consumers as economic growth was lifted, which meant wages rose, borrowing costs lowered, and lending increased.</p>
<p>In 2018, the ECB confirmed that it would stop its bond-buying scheme to stimulate the economy. However, in 2020, the covid pandemic saw a return to central bank largesse with the Pandemic Emergency Purchasing Programme (PEPP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who are the Key Figures on the Governing Council?</h2>
<p>There are 25 representatives on the Governing Council, but they don’t all have voting rights. Instead, 21 voting rights are shared between the representatives. The ECB’s executive board has a total of six members, with each having a vote at each meeting. The rest of the votes are split between two groups.</p>
<h4>Group 1</h4>
<p>This group is determined by the five countries with the largest economies. Four voting rights are shared and this is rotated every month between countries.</p>
<h4>Group 2</h4>
<p>This group consists of the remaining 14 countries. There are 11 voting rights distributed amongst the group and this also rotates every month.</p>
<h4>The Current executive board of the governing council:</h4>

<h2>European Central Bank History</h2>
<p>Before the establishment of the ECB, the European Monetary Institute was responsible for issues regarding states adopting the euro. The EMI was part of the second stage of the EU’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Then the ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998, but could not exercise all of its powers until the Euro was introduced on 1 January 1999.</p>
<p>The very first president of the ECB was Wim Duisenberg, who was the former president of the Dutch central bank and the European Monetary Institute. However, Dusienberg was not welcomed by the French government and argued that the ECB should have a French president, seeing as the location was set to be in Germany. There were also rising tensions with the executive board, the United Kingdom wanted a place even though it had not joined the single currency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Coronavirus, and which countries are affected?</h2>
<p>Covid-19, is an individual virus and is part of the coronavirus family. While there was no name for the new virus, people were calling it coronavirus and the term has stuck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10335"></span></p>
<h4>Covid-19 origin and spread</h4>
<p>It’s not 100 percent clear how the virus originated but Covid-19 is very similar to the coronavirus that bats get. An immunology and microbiology scientist, Kristian Andersen, PhD, thinks that an intermediate host facilitated the spread from bats to humans.</p>
<p>The reason the impact is so vast is that humans have had no contact with it before. We lack immunity against it and is why so many people have, and will likely become, infected and die from the virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Affected Countries</h4>
<p>On March 22, China was the most affected country with 81,054 confirmed cases, followed by Italy with 53,578 and the USA with 29,214. However, it is difficult to compare the total figure from one country to another. As an example, China only reported severe cases, and did not include people that had tested positively but did not have any symptoms. While Italy reported more groups than only severe cases as China reported.</p>
<p>The country with the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths is changing as the virus spreads. At the time of writing the pandemic is still out of control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Covid-19 Symptoms and transmission</h4>
<p>Some of the typical coronavirus symptoms are fever, dry cough, and fatigue, while more uncommon symptoms include nasal congestions, sore throat, and headaches.</p>
<p>It’s not 100 percent clear how the Coronavirus is transmitted. The World Health Organization has recommended to regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. They also recommend that you do not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth as you might have the virus on your hands.</p>
<p>Social distancing is also important, and you should keep at least one meter away from anyone else, especially those that are coughing or sneezing. This is to avoid coming into contact with small liquid droplets from their mouth or nose that could contain the virus. If you’re unwell, then you should stay home for at least seven days, according to the UK government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Economic Impact</h4>
<p>Economically, the pain caused by Covid-19 is substantial as countries opt for draconian measures to stop the spread. Countries have demanded their citizens stay at home and not go to work. This has led to unemployment increases and a drop in GDP as factories and workplaces shut down.</p>
<p>China was the first country to shut down, and annual China Retail sales dropped by 20.5% in February, from positive growth of eight percent in January. Annual industrial production declined by 13.5% in February, after growing 6.9% the month before. Unofficial economic trackers by the Financial Times suggest that the Chinese economy was growing about 25% lower than normal for this time of year. To support their findings they looked at power plant coal consumption, container freight, traffic congestion, air pollution, and Box office admissions.</p>
<p>In the US, approximately 3.5 million people lost their jobs in a single week as people stayed at home. This was by recommendation of the government in order to curb the spread of the virus. The Coronavirus’s big impact on the world economy had, therefore, an even greater impact on the world’s <a href="/en/markets" rel=" noopener">financial markets</a>, as investors tend to overreact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How has Coronavirus affected major indices?</h3>
<p><a href="/en/markets/indices-trading" rel=" noopener">Major indices</a> have declined sharply and very few companies have been spared. Investors sold stock indices ahead of the anticipated lockdown of economies and higher unemployment rates.</p>
<p>In the following section, we will take a look at the Dow Jones, Dax Index, the FTSE 100, Hang Seng, FTSE MIB, and the Nikkei 225.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Dow Jones</h4>
<p>When the Coronavirus started to make headlines in late January, the Dow Jones brushed away the concerns. That changed once the China PMI declined to a record low and Covid-19 spread in Italy. The Dow Jones started declining from its 2020-high, with the index being down by 35.7% on March 22, 2020. The index traded at its 2016 levels, as the virus spread uncontrollably in the USA, causing people to sell the companies that make up the Dow Jones.</p>
<h4>DAX Index</h4>
<p>On March 23, 2020, the DAX index was down by 37.7% from its 2020-high of 13,836, and had given up seven years of profits as it traded at its 2013 levels. Lufthansa, Germany’s biggest airline and a component of the DAX 30 index, had lost 73% of its value from its 2017 high, and the CEO Carsten Spohr, said: “The Lufthansa Group after the crisis won’t return to the old normal status and just continue flying as usual, we react twice as strongly to changes in the world economy. Lufthansa Group as a result will shrink.”</p>
<h4>FTSE 100</h4>
<p>The FTSE 100 had, like many other developed stock indices, declined strongly on the Coronavirus shutdown, and was down by 37.5% from its 2018 high on March 23. Further uncertainty for the UK as the EU head Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, contracted the new virus. The UK Brexit negotiator David Frost has also self-isolated himself with Covid-19 symptoms at the time of writing.</p>
<h4>Hang Seng</h4>
<p>The Hong Kong stock index, the Hang Seng, was down by 35.2% from its 2018 high. The index had stabilized from mid-2018 as the pressure from the US-China trade war tensions abated, however, on the outbreak of Coronavirus in China, the index had fallen by 26% and was trading at 2016 levels.</p>
<h4>FTSE MIB 40</h4>
<p>Italy is the epicenter of the second leg of the Coronavirus spread after China. The government was slow to react at first, but on March 9, they forced the country to shut down. This did slow the momentum of the Covid-19 spread however, we saw little support for the Italian stock market index. The FTSE MIB, and the index was down by 40% from its 2020-high of 25500, giving back eight years of gains.</p>
<h4>Nikkei 225</h4>
<p>The Japanese stock market index, the Nikkei 225 was down by 30.92% from its 2020 high on March 23, and trading at 2016 levels. The Bank of Japan has pledged to increase asset purchases and support struggling banks. The markets appeared to have ignored the news as the focus remains on the Coronavirus spread in the US. Next up for Japan is the probable cancelation of the 2020 Olympic games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How has Coronavirus affected major Forex pairs?</h3>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has caused large volatility and uncertainty in <a href="/en/markets/forex-trading" rel=" noopener">the currency market</a>. The USDJPY and EURUSD have been on quite the roller-coaster as both experienced significant bullish and bearish breakouts. With investors first stockpiling Euro’s and Japanese Yen, only for the trend to reverse and the Dollar receiving a major boost.</p>
<h4>GBP/USD</h4>
<p>The British Pound, GBPUSD, managed to keep its gain as the Euro slid at the start of the year vs. the Dollar. However, on March 9, when Italy chose to lockdown, the GBPUSD embarked on a sharp decline that took the price from 1.3200 to 1.1441 in nine trading days.</p>
<p>While other European countries decided to lockdown to protect their elderly population, PM Johnson and his advisors adopted the strategy of “herd immunity.” This means that you allow about 60% of the population to get infected with the new Coronavirus in order to build resistance. Later, they changed their strategy as research showed that up to half a million people could die in the process. The government then asked people to self-distance themselves.</p>
<p>Another strain on GBPUSD is the threat of a no-deal Brexit. The Chief EU Brexit negotiator attracted Covid-19, and so have members of the UK delegation, all increasing the likelihood of a hard Brexit by the end of 2020.</p>
<h4>EUR/USD</h4>
<p>The EURUSD pair experienced a volatile start to 2020. At first, the price declined as the American economy was outperforming the Eurozone. Volatility increased as coronavirus hit and from February 20, the price rose by 725 pips.</p>
<p>Then precisely one month later, the price gave up all the gains and reached a new multi-year low of 1.0638. From its 2020-high, the EURUSD had lost 861 pips.</p>
<p>The move upwards from February 20, appears to have been because of Euro borrowers. Who rushed to hedge their positions by buying Euros as Italy was about to close down. Later when the coronavirus panic spread to the U.S. the demand for Dollars surged, and EURUSD collapsed.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve was then forced to introduce Dollar Swap arrangements with banks to provide dollars to firms and investors that required it.</p>
<h4>USD/JPY</h4>
<p>On the heels of the coronavirus crisis, the USDJPY experienced a roller-coaster ride, much like the EURUSD pair.</p>
<p>On February 19, the USDJPY exploded higher as rumors circulated that the 2020 Olympics in Japan would be canceled or delayed. It reached a high of 112.24 before a mere 17 days later, tumbling by 1052.9 pips to a low of 101.17. Then the price clawed back almost 100% of its losses in 14 days. The move higher was motivated by higher US government bond yields, and a general shortage of US Dollars worldwide.</p>
<h4>GBP/JPY</h4>
<p>Trading in the GBPJPY was relatively quiet until February 28 when the pair breached the 140.75 to 144.92 range. From 140.75, GBPJPY plunged by 1660 pips or 11.81%, which is a huge move for a currency pair.</p>
<p>The Japanese Yen is considered a safe haven currency and tends to see support at the time of crisis. The Bank of England also rushed to cut their interest rates and did so in an unannounced meeting, which further dented the value of the British Pound vs. the Japanese Yen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How has Coronavirus affected major commodities?</h3>
<p>Gold prices rallied on the news of coronavirus spreading, however, as the crisis escalated, it was cash that drew interest from investors as we saw stocks, <a href="/en/markets/commodities/gold-trading" rel=" noopener">gold</a>, and treasuries decline. <a href="/en/markets/commodities/oil-trading" rel="noopener">Crude oil</a> prices followed a more traditional path as prices lowered due to the demand for crude oil plunging. This happened at nearly the same time as crude oil production was set to soar as the OPEC+ group failed to set joint production quotas.</p>
<h4>Crude oil prices</h4>
<p>Crude oil prices started to trade lower around January 21, when news broke about the fast-spreading Coronavirus in China. At that time WTI crude oil prices were trading around 59 dollars per barrel.</p>
<p>The price reached a low of 49.50 dollars in the first week of February, as the momentum of Covid-19 in China slowed. During this time, the Shanghai Composite started to trade higher.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, OPEC and Russia tried to agree on an oil production decrease as the demand was slowing because of the Coronavirus. No agreement was made, and instead, they dissolved the pact that they had entered, meaning everyone was free to produce as much as they wanted.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia decided to punish the rest of the crude oil producers by providing discounts of about 6 to 8 dollar per barrel vs. the Brent Crude oil benchmark. WTI crude oil price declined by about 26 dollars per barrel or 56.75% from the March 6 open price of 46 USD. At the time of writing, the price was down by 66% from its 2020 high.</p>
<h4>Gold prices</h4>
<p>Gold acted as a haven asset as the Coronavirus engulfed the world, and the price rose by about 8.26% or 130 USD per ounce from late January.</p>
<p>As the gold price reached a high of $1703.66 on March 9, it started to lose momentum.</p>
<p>Hedge funds and investors tend to balance their positions by holding stock markets, bonds, and gold. However, as the Dow Jones was down by 20% from its 2020 high on March 9, investors started to book profits in gold to cover their equity losses, causing gold prices to soften.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the EURUSD also peaked, so the move lower in gold prices was also due to the surge in demand for Dollars.</p>
<p>It is not clear why the Dollar surged, my theory is that holders of dollar loans needed to hedge their positions, of which were very large. According to the IMF, lending in dollars by foreign banks reached 12 trillion dollars in 2019, which is 56% of US GDP, a significant amount, this could explain why we saw such a rush to the dollar and in turn affect the price of gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How has Coronavirus affected the stock market?</h3>
<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel=" noopener">Stock markets</a> have been crushed as measures to combat the coronavirus have changed the way we live. At the time of writing, March 23, the people of Europe had already been under lockdown, and the US was following. As people stay at home, they can’t consume as they normally would. This has caused entire industries such as hotels and airlines into mass redundancies or simply, collapse. In China, things have begun to go back to normality as the economy has started to bounce. The closure of Europe and the USA has caused increased volatility in the markets and offers trading opportunities, depending on how you think the coronavirus crisis will develop.</p>
<h4>Netflix, a “stay at home” stock</h4>
<p>Netflix is one of the few shares that are up in 2020. It’s anticipated that they’ll see an increase of users in the coming weeks, as people are forced to stay at home.</p>
<p>The stock has not been without volatility, and from its 2020-high the share was down by 28% on March 17, only to recover to 10% down on March 23.</p>
<p>You can find Netflix under the ticker #NFLX on the ATFX trading platform.</p>
<h4>Ocado UK, a “online supermarket” stock</h4>
<p>Ocado PLC is a UK online supermarket delivery company that has seen unprecedented demand in the weeks leading up to the UK coronavirus lockdown. Today, its waiting list for delivery is a number of weeks compared to the normal next day service. At one point, customers were waiting for hours online just to place an order. Ocado’s latest move is not to accept new clients. Ocado was down 22% on the year in March, but later surged by 56% from its 2020-low.</p>
<p>Find Ocado under the ticker #OCDO.</p>
<h4>Lufthansa, an “airline stocks”</h4>
<p>Airlines have been hit hard as people have been forced to stop flying. Some airlines, like SAS, have made up to 90% of their staff redundant to deal with the aftermath of no-flying.</p>
<p>Some airlines are even at the risk of being nationalized, which could wipe the holding of private shareholders. However, this has not stopped some investors to speculate on a bounce, because when the dust settles, people are bound to start flying again.</p>
<p>The question is, will Lufthansa bounce back and if it does by how much? Will it return to its glory days? The share price was down by 72% from its 2017 high on March 24, 2020.</p>
<p>You can find Lufthansa under the ticker #LHA in the ATFX trading platform.</p>
<h4>3M, a “Facemask stock”</h4>
<p>The 3M Company has surged in google searches as their protective face masks are used by health care staff and the public to protect themselves from Covid-19.</p>
<p>What is missed is that 3M is a well-diversified firm, which offers about 60,000 products, with facemask making up a small percentage of their total sales. Many of their factories are in China, which saw limited production due to the virus, so for the firm, a booming economy is more important than increased mask sales to their business. Their share price consequently dropped by 54% from its 2018 high at the time of writing, March 23, 2020.</p>
<p>You can find 3M under the ticker #MMM in the ATFX trading platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Interesting times ahead</h3>
<p>As highlighted, the coronavirus, Covid-19, has had a huge impact on people’s lives, the economy, and the financial markets. With this volatility does come opportunities to trade the markets. Volatility brings both risk and reward so making sure you have a clear view of the market is important. If the coronavirus continues to spread and cause a longer-term recession, initial assumptions would be for further declines to stocks and crude oil.</p>
<p>While if things begin to settle down, as we’re seeing in China (at the time of writing, March 23), then stock markets could bounce, especially as governments and central banks are flooding the markets with liquidity. As for the Forex markets, the outlook will depend on which country can first bounce back, or if the situation turns really bad, which country is coping the best. What is your take on the markets?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is the OPEC meeting?</h2>
<p>The OPEC meeting is the bi-annual meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and OPEC is probably one of the most important groups in the world. They are important as they have a strong influence on <a href="/en/markets/commodities/oil-trading" rel="noopener">crude oil prices</a> and supply, and therefore indirectly – your energy and transportation costs.</p>
<p><span id="more-10320"></span></p>
<p>From a trader’s perspective, the meeting is important as comments leading up to the meeting and actual decisions at the meetings tend to set the trend for crude oil prices. There are two meetings per year, but OPEC can meet more than two times a year if they think it is necessary.</p>
<p>In January 2019, the group consisted of fourteen member countries, with Saudi Arabia being the unofficial leader. In 2016, OPEC was behind 44% of the world’s crude oil production, and they had control of 81.5% of the world’s proven oil reserves according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Other large and important OPEC members include Iraq, with daily crude oil production of 4.4 million barrels a day in 2016, followed by Iran at 3.9 million barrels, and UEA at 3.1 million. However, all of these countries are dwarfed by Saudi Arabia and their production of 10.4 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When is the next OPEC announcement?</h2>
<p>The next official OPEC meeting will take place on June 25 and 26, 2019.</p>
<p>The meeting takes place two times a year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>5 December 2019</em> &#8211; 177th meeting of the OPEC Conference &#8211; Vienna, Austria</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>6 December 2019</em> &#8211; 7th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting &#8211; Vienna, Austria</p>
<p><span style="color: #0f2c52;font-size: 33px;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent"></span><span style="color: #0f2c52;font-size: 33px;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">How does the OPEC affect crude oil traders?</span></p>
<p>Each month, OPEC will publish figures on actual crude oil production by its members, traders use this to get an understanding if supply is increasing or decreasing. Large swings might influence crude oil prices if production is too large or too low compared with their predetermined crude oil production targets.</p>
<p>However, more importantly, in the OPEC meeting, the members will share their future crude oil production targets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How does OPEC change the oil price and oil production?</h2>
<p>OPEC will indirectly control crude oil prices by altering their crude oil production. If demand remains the same, but they lower their supply, then crude oil prices should increase. While, if they increase supply, and demand remains the same, crude oil prices should decline.</p>
<p>OPEC does not control demand, but they make assumptions about demand and try to produce crude oil to keep prices stable at a favorable price for its members, without causing too much trouble for its buyers. They are aware that if they keep prices too high that large oil consumers will try to shift away from crude oil.</p>
<p>In the past, OPEC had some control over crude oil prices, but the increased production of shale oil, the dominance of OPEC has diminished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How has OPEC affected crude oil prices in the past?</h2>
<p>Following the Yom Kippur War, in October 1973, OPEC decided to reduce their production significantly and to introduce an oil embargo against the US and other nations that supported Israel in the war. OPEC’s action caused a large spike in crude oil prices, and they traded from 3 dollars per barrel to 12 dollars. In the US, energy rationing was introduced, and in the UK the workweek was cut from five days to three days, while in seven European countries, non important Sunday driving was banned.</p>
<p>The oil embargo ended in March 1974, but prices remained high, and it led to a global economic recession, high unemployment rate and inflation.</p>
<p>By 1980 crude oil prices had reached a high of 40 dollars per barrel following the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war. As prices were high, industrialized countries made efforts to switch away from crude oil usage, and exploration by Non-OPEC countries was ramped up. As an effect, crude oil demand declined, and total world crude production increased, this caused crude oil prices to plunge.</p>
<p>To try to stabilize the price, OPEC in 1982 introduced audited national quotas. However, this failed as some members did not comply. Saudi Arabia did its best to cut its production and did so by 66% from 1981 to 1985, but this did not help to boost crude oil prices. Instead, they ramped up production to cause crude oil prices to plunge below 10 dollars per barrel, and thereby make high costs production outside of Saudi Arabia to suffer.</p>
<p>The most recent episode of heavy OPEC intervention was from 2014 to 2018. From 2008 to 2016 US crude oil production doubled, as shale oil production made it more feasible to produce crude oil in the US.</p>
<p>Over the same period, OPEC members consistently produced more oil, and the Chinese economy was slowing down, and requiring less crude oil. From its 2014 highs of $115 per barrel, prices slumped by 89% to their 2016 low of $27.</p>
<p>It took time for the prices to regain their footing, as Saudi Arabia was applying the same strategy of the 1980s to drive out high-cost producers. As the low crude oil prices started to tire out OPEC members and drive out high-cost producers, OPEC began to reduce their production in 2016, to ramp up the cuts in 2017 and 2018. At the time of writing in early 2019, the price was trading at $70 per barrel, a significant improvement from the June 2016 to October 2017 average price of 50 dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is the Federal Open Market Committee meeting?</h2>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is a regular session held by members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve (FED). At the FOMC meeting, its members decide on the future of US monetary policy. Typically, they will set the discount rate, which is the interest rate at which US banks can borrow money from the Federal Reserve. The FED has the power to lend and print an unlimited amount of money, therefore the discount rate it sets becomes a benchmark for all banks. If the interest rate of all other banks is higher than the discount rate then a bank can borrow money from the central banks at the discount rate, instead of borrowing from its peers. This means the FED funds rate, which is the rate at which banks charge each other, does not deviate too much from the discount rate. During the FOMC meeting, decisions are also made on quantitative easing or quantitative tightening programs. These programs are where the FED buys and sells government bonds.</p>
<p><span id="more-10304"></span></p>
<p>Fed Meeting Schedule</p>
<p>The next meeting will take place on June 18-19, with any policy changes announced on June 19, 2019. Since 2019, the FOMC publishes a statement as well as holding a press conference, to answer questions from the media.</p>

<p>Jan 29, 2020</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How does the FOMC meeting affect the markets?</h3>
<p>On the second day of each rate meeting, the FOMC share its view on the US economy and address any possible changes to the US monetary policy. The central bank’s tries to influence the state of the US economy and its inflation path via interest rates and quantitative easing or tightening programs.</p>
<p>However, in the immediate future, its direct impact is on short-term interest rates. This normally has a direct impact on bonds, Forex, and indices.</p>
<p>Forex: the overnight charges (swap rates) that you receive or are charged by your broker, are typically based on the threemonth LIBOR rate, which is directly affected by any actual and anticipated changes to the discount rate.</p>
<p>In short, an increase in the FED funds rates tends to strengthen the US Dollar, as investors and traders are now paid higher interest rates by holding dollars. However, if the FOMC decides to lower interest rates or introduce quantitative easing, the dollar tends to soften, as the discount rate is now lower.</p>
<p>Stock market indices, such as the S&amp;P 500, will at times react strongly to the FED’s actions, but it depends on where in the cycle the economy is. A critical time is when the economy is running hot, and the Fed aggressively increases interest rates to combat the economy from overheating. Another critical time is when the economy is heading towards a recession, and the economy needs lower rates to return to growth. The FOMC decisions influence interest rates and bond rates, and in the long run, they tend to affect the real economy as higher interest rates will make mortgages, credit card spending, auto loans, and student loans more expensive and vice versa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is the Federal Funds rate?</h3>
<p>The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which participating banks of the FED system lend balances at the Federal Reserve to other depository institutions overnight. The banks set themselves this rate and it depends entirely on supply and demand. However, it will not deviate much from the FED discount rate as it acts as a substitution. In other words, if the federal funds rate is too high then a participating bank can borrow money from the FED. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate for on loans overnight, much like the discount rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Federal Reserve quantitative easing?</h3>
<p>In the last decade, Quantitative easing (QE) was an extra measure introduced by the Federal Reserve, as the discount rate was about to reach the zero bound and the FED was not ready to impose negative interest rates to boost lending. But the zero-bound of the discount rate was just one part of the problem. As the discount rate is a short-term interest rate, it will influence short-term lending between banks, and not have a direct impact on longer-term bond rates, such as the US ten-year government bond yield or the 30-year mortgage rates of homeowners. Instead, QE was introduced, to allow the Federal Reserve to buy an unlimited amount of bonds on the secondary market to artificially lower interest rates, where they were deemed as most necessary. By March 2009, the FED held $1.75 trillion of bank debt, mortgage-backed securities, and Treasury notes, and the amount increased to $2.1 trillion by June 2010, according to Ali, Abdulmalik in “Quantitative Monetary Easing: The history and impacts on financial markets“.Academia.edu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FED meeting dates</h3>
<p>The FOMC meets eight times a year, but if the situation warrants it, they can also meet at any time. Policy changes are announced at the end of each meeting, and starting from 2019, a televised press release follows each meeting. The televised press release offers additional insights behind the thinking of the FED, as journalists are given the opportunity to ask questions. Traders gage the mood of the FED chair, they analyze his tone of voice and body language when he delivers his statement and answers questions. The minutes are made available to the public three weeks after the FED meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>History of the FOMC</h3>
<p>In 1913, the Federal Reserve was made up by twelve geographical districts, each with their distinct Reserve Bank. The sectioning was based on the prevailing trade regions that existed in 1913, and don’t coincide with current state lines. The original idea was that each Reserve bank would independently set a discount rate to serve each region best. However, by 1933 and 1935 the US economy was so integrated that the FOMC was born. The FOMC has since then decided on the discount rate for the whole country.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee is made up by seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and these members are appointed by the US president, and the president of New York Fed, and four other Fed presidents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Doves and Hawks</h3>
<p>The chair of the FOMC and Fed, currently Jerome Powell, is perceived to be the most important member as his comments and actions sway much of the work of the FOMC. Powell’s views tend to be centrist in relation to the views of the other Fed and FOMC members. Members are then classified as “doves” or “hawks.” Hawks tend to focus on inflation and raising interest rates to combat inflation even when there is no inflation. Doves, on the other hand, prefer having low-interest rates to support the labor market and are less worried about inflation. Traders pay attention to who says what as it might hint about what lays ahead for monetary policy. A Dove talking about keeping interest rates low is not out of the ordinary and would usually not garner much attention, but a dove talking about the need to raise interest rates would be viewed as a reason to expect higher interest rates in the future. While a hawk not worrying about inflation would be perceived as a clue that future monetary policy will be less restrictive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is a Trade War?</h2>
<p>A trade war is when one country raises its tariffs on imports, in retaliation the affected country will also do the same as a way of protectionism. This then tends to escalate causing a reduction in trade between the two countries and lower economic growth forboth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10296"></span></p>
<h4>How has the Trade War affected the Market?</h4>
<p>Currency devaluation is commonly associated with trade wars. As a way of releasing the pressure on the export sector, the country involved will normally devalue their domestic currencies. In the midst of a tariff war between China and the US, the People’s Bank of China set the reference rate for CNY, to 6.7671 CNY against USD. This was a 0.9% reduction from previous levels.</p>
<p><strong>Trump took to Twitter instantly and expressed his views:</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/Existing%20Pages/Existing%20pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Financial%20events%20%3E%20Trade%20war/images/trump_avatar@2x.jpg" alt="trump_avatar@2x" width="140" style="width: 140px;float: left;margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px"><strong>Donald J. Trump&nbsp;<img decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/Existing%20Pages/Existing%20pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Financial%20events%20%3E%20Trade%20war/icons/icon_twitter.svg" alt="icon_twitter" width="30" style="width: 30px"></strong><br />@realDonaldTrump</p>
<p><strong>“China, the E.U. and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower,while the U.S is raising rates and the USD gets stronger – taking away our big competitive. As usual, not a level playing field.”</strong></p>
<p>The USD Index dropped to more than 1% as a result of this tweet. Both CNY and the USD were impacted negatively. Regardless of Bullish or Bearish markets, the USD could be impacted in various ways which include:</p>
<p><strong>FED Policy:</strong> The USD value also relies heavily on the decision made by the FED. Increasing the fund rate will limit inflationary pressures and therefore promotes monetary strength.</p>
<p><strong>Periodic Volatility:</strong> The announcements of new tariffs will inevitably cause short term volatility to the USD, as will the enactment of existing ones.</p>
<p><strong>Chances of Devaluation:</strong> This is unlikely but the USD could be devalued as a strategy to boost economic growth.</p>
<p>Markets to Watch during The Trade War</p>
<p><a href="/en/markets" rel=" noopener">Global markets</a> have experienced volatility as a response to the trade war. The implications of the trade war not only affects a number of companies but it will also have an impact on consumers. Outlined below are the key markets to watch as the situation around the trade war heightens. As of May 7, 2019, analysts are concerned that the Trump administration could unleash higher tariffs by the end of the week, causing tensions to continue heightening.</p>
<h4>Indices</h4>
<p><a href="/en/markets/indices-trading" rel=" noopener">Indices</a> such as the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have already faced a sharp plumet in the markets. Not only will the US indexes be affected but the trade war could also hit the global markets and in turn affect the DAX or the FTSE 100. Tuesday 7 May 2019 stocks plummeted and bonds rose in a safety trade. The Dow Jones fell more than 473, the S&amp;P 500 was off 48 points, according to reports from CNBC. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index also dropped by 0.4%, this has reached its lowest level since April 1, 2019. Even the London Stock Exchange faces a drastic drop, the FTSE 100 lost 28 points and as of May 9, 2019, it is trading at its lowest level since March which is 7,230.</p>
<h4>Stocks</h4>
<p>Business in the US will certainly feel a hit from the trade war tensions. Sectors which may be impacted include manufacturing, agriculture, the American auto industry, and the retail industry. One of the reasons for these industries facing a drastic hit is because of their reliance on the global supply chain. We could potentially see rising input costs and supply limitations due to rising tariffs. Not only will the American market face the consequences of Trump’s decision to raise tariffs but China’s economy will be sure to suffer as well.</p>
<h4>Commodities</h4>
<p>Supply and demand has been impacted due to the trade wars therefore there will be a change in <a href="/en/markets/commodities" rel=" noopener">the commodities markets</a> between the world’s largest economies. Trump threatened further actions to tariffs on March 6, 2019, as a result of this <a href="/en/markets/commodities/oil-trading" rel="noopener">crude oil</a> dropped by 2% in the commodities market.</p>
<h4>Forex</h4>
<p>The US dollar is continuously fluctuating against the other global currencies creating uncertainty in <a href="/en/markets/forex-trading" rel=" noopener">the forex market</a>. The currencies likely to be affected include the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, and safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Trump’s Trade War</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump introduced a 25% tariff on steel imports as well as a 10% tariff on aluminium. This was announced on March 8, 2018. As a result, <a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel=" noopener">global stock markets</a> plummeted in anticipated fear of a trade war. Prior to Trump’s presidency, the only body that had the power to impose tariffs was the US Congress. As Trump wanted to impose new tariffs on China, he used something called the National Emergencies Act.</p>
<p>This act was intended for the president, allowing them to have special powers in a national crisis, therefore overruling the</p>
<p>Congress. Trump used this and stated that the US depended on imported metals, which threatened the country’s ability to make weapons.</p>
<p>As a result of this, eight countries filed in complaints to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) due to the fact that America is the world’s largest steel importer. Prices were raised and it especially hit automakers quite hard. In order to get around this, prices were then raised for consumers.</p>
<h4>The exemption of South Korea</h4>
<p>March 26, 2018, appeared to be a turning point. Trump decided to exempt South Korea from the steel tariff. However, in return, this meant South Korea would have to amend the Bilateral Agreement from 2012. At the time the US’s tariff of 25% on pickup trucks would have expired in 2021, but amending the agreement meant that there was an extension of ten years on the tariff. Australia, Argentina, and Brazil were also exempt from the steel tariffs.</p>
<p>What followed was global retaliation. Following a G7 meeting, Justin Trudeau the Canadian Prime Minister decided that Canada would also raise its tariffs. Mexico was the next country to announce tariffs on US industries that supported Trump.</p>
<h4>Turkish Lira in an all-time low against the USD</h4>
<p>On August 10, 2018, Trump decided to double tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from Turkey. His reason behind this was Turkey’s imprisonment of American pastor Andrew Brunson. The Turkish Lira plummeted against the US dollar, raising fears of a financial crisis within the Eurozone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The US and China Trade War Timeline</h3>
<p>The China-US trade war led to the commodities sector being hit drastically. Tariffs had been put onto materials which reduced trade between the two giant economies. Traders feared an economic slowdown. These two factors working hand in hand meant that raw materials faced a drag, especially since demand for commodities started to slacken.</p>
<p>When exports are less than imports it is known as a trade deficit. Addressing this was a huge priority for Trump when he was elected. Whilst this was Trump’s vision, in the East there was were other ideas forming. President XiJinping was elected and his ideologies centred around making China the biggest economy in the world, pushing towards technology rather than manufacturing cheap goods for Western companies. The first action Trump took was to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, followed by an investigation into trade deficits with China.</p>
<h4>January 22nd, 2018</h4>
<p>President Trump imposed tariffs and quotas on imported Chinese solar panels and washing machines. From here tensions arose and the situation escalated forming a pressured timeline of events.</p>
<p>China filed a complaint with the WTO in August 2018. What followed the US’s decision in January was a back-and-forth of increasing tariffs. The Trump administration announced in March 2018, that it would levy tariffs on $60 billion of imports from China. They also said U.S technology transfers to Chinese companies would be limited. China hit back by announcing tariffs on $3 billion in U.S. fruit, pork, recycled aluminium, and steel pipes.</p>
<h4>March 26th, 2018</h4>
<p>Chinese trade officials and the Trump administration started negotiating. The Trump Administration made three requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>China needs to reduce its tariffs on U.S. automobiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China should import more U.S. semiconductors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American companies should be granted more access to China’s financial sector</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>April 3rd, 2018</h4>
<p>The administration announced the possibility of raising tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imported electronics, machinery, and aerospace. Within hours China responded by raising its tariffs to 25% on $50 billion of U.S. exports to China. The tariffs targeted 106 American products. Penalties were also placed on the Sorghum and Boeing aeroplanes. The main industries targeted by China were ones who supported Trump in the 2016 election.</p>
<p>Soybean imports are vital to China for food production. Prior to the tariff war, China imported $12 billion in soybeans. In March 2018 this all changed, China made the decision to cancel the existing contract with the U.S., the reason being it would affect U.S. markets more than it would damage China’s. Over a period of 55 days, soybean futures declined by approximately 23%.</p>
<h4>April 6th, 2018</h4>
<p>$100 billion more of Chinese imports were about to be affected when Trump declared tariffs.</p>
<h4>April 10th, 2018</h4>
<p>Trade negotiations had started to deteriorate according to China. The ‘Made in China 2025’ plan meant China was subsidising its 10 prioritised industries and the U.S. didn’t like this, what followed was a demand for China to stop subsidising. The industries included robotics, aerospace, and software.</p>
<h4>May 4th, 2018</h4>
<p>Five demands were made to China from the Trump Administration:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End subsidies to tech companies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China should stop stealing U.S. intellectual property</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tariffs on U.S. good needs to be cut by 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening China’s markets to more U.S. investments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need to reduce the trade deficit by $200 billion by 2020</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>China agreed to import more U.S. products on May 10, 2018. Then on the 15th May 2018, China agreed to remove the tariffs on U.S. pork imports, and deals were exchanged regarding telecoms. China allowed Qualcomm to acquire NXP, and in return, the U.S. removed the tariff on ZTE, a Chinese telecom company.</p>
<h4>May 29th, 2018</h4>
<p>The Trump Administration said it would announce a list of products set to receive a tariff by June 15, 2018. Firstly it planned to target $50 billion in imports from China, this would be done by June 30, 2018.</p>
<h4>July 6th, 2018</h4>
<p>Tariffs made by the administration went into effect for $34 billion of Chinese imports. China levied a 40% tariff on U.S. autos. As well as autos they decided to levy tariffs on U.S agricultural exports as well. This left U.S farmers with more produce than they accounted for, to appease them Trump offered $12 billion in subsidies.</p>
<h4>July 10th, 2018</h4>
<p>A 10% tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese imports was announced as a possibility by the Trump Administration. This went into effect on the 10th of September. There were also threats placed to increase tariffs by 25% after the 1st of January, 2019, on a variety of goods such as luggage, handbags, fish, apparel, etc. China returned with a threat to add tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. exports. The ball was thrown back to the U.S. and Trump returned with a threat to add tariffs to all $500 billion of Chinese imports. If this was to come into effect it would have dire consequences as economic growth would reduce by 0.75 points in 2018.</p>
<h4>August 23rd, 2018</h4>
<p>A 25% tariff on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods came into effect. This applied to industrial equipment such as tractors, plastic tubes, and chemicals. China also implemented a 25% tariff on $16 billion worth of U.S goods which included autos and coals.</p>
<h4>December 1st, 2018</h4>
<p>President Trump and President Xi Jinping met at the G-20 Conference, through talks Trump agreed to hold off any tariff increases scheduled for January 2019. Instead, the Trump Administration will cover 142 issues in a negotiated agreement.</p>
<p>Initially, negotiators had a deadline of March 1, 2019, before Trump would move forward with the scheduled tariff increases. However, on February 27, 2019, the administration announced that it had decided to drop any threats of imposing the tariff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is GDP?</h2>
<p>GDP is short for Gross domestic product, and it is the broadest measure of economic activity in a country. Economists, traders, and the financial press widely cite it, as a very weak or strong GDP reading might quickly shift stock market indices and currency rates. It is also one of the economic indicators used to determine if an economy is in a recession or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10285"></span></p>
<h3>When is the next US GDP report going to be published?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product, 1st quarter 2019 April 26, 8:30 AM EST</li>
<li>Gross Domestic Product, 2nd quarter 2019 July 26, 8:30 AM EST</li>
<li>Gross Domestic Product, 3rd quarter 2019 October 30, 8:30 AM EST</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What does GDP Measure?</h3>
<p>It is impossible to know exactly what is being produced in a country at any given time, but the GDP is the closest we can get to an estimate.</p>
<p>The income approach is one way of estimating GDP, and in its simplest form, it adds up what the population of a country earned in a whole year. The income approach includes total compensation to employees, gross profits of companies, taxes, and deducts any subsidies.</p>
<p>The expenditure approach is the other way of estimating GDP and is the most commonly used. Here we take the sum of consumer spending, investment, government spending, exports, and deduct imports.</p>
<p>Consumer spending is broken down into goods and services, while investments are broken down into non-residential and residential investment. Exports and imports are categorised into services and goods.</p>
<p>Together these key sectors make up the Gross Domestic Product. We include the word “Domestic” as the measures exclude goods and services produced in another country.</p>
<p>For example, if a country consumes and invests 10 trillion dollars, exports for 2 trillion, has a government spending of 1 trillion, but imports goods for 10 trillion, then GDP will amount to 3 trillion. As 10 + 2 +1 – 10 = 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How is GDP Calculated?</h3>
<p>The actual GDP amount in dollars is relevant when comparing country economy sizes, while in financial investing and forex trading, the participants are interested in growth rates.</p>
<p>According to the International Monetary Fund, the largest economy in the world in 2018 was China with a total of 25,238.56 billion dollars, followed by the European Union (which is not a country), and the United States in the third position.</p>
<p>In most countries, GDP is published every quarter, with at least one month’s delay. In some countries, such as Canada, GDP is published monthly.</p>
<p>There are two ways the Gross Domestic Product is represented. The first and most popular measure is the quarterly change; this measure is then multiplied by four to obtain an estimate of the annual growth, if the quarterly growth would persist for four straight quarters. Financial markets tend to focus on this annualized measure, but as it is a volatile gauge it is prone to change from quarter to quarter.</p>
<p>Instead, economists tend to focus on the yearly growth rate of GDP.</p>
<p>e.g. the first quarter of 2019 GDP reading is compared with the first quarter GDP reading of 2018. This way of representing GDP gives a smoother representation and is probably most relevant to the public as wages and mortgage contracts etc., change infrequently. The yearly change measure is also preferred by central banks, as single quarters of GDP growth can be misleading to the true state of the economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why does GDP matter for Forex and Stock Market Traders?</h3>
<p>GDP is the most complete indicator of the state of the economy and is, therefore, an important input for central banks and governments. As an example, NATO countries are committed to spending a certain percentage of their yearly GDP on military spending. For traders, it is how the central bank such as the Federal Reserve reacts to the growth of GDP.</p>
<p><a href="/en/analysis/financial-events/european-central-bank-meeting" rel=" noopener">The central bank</a> itself has little impact on the long-term average of GDP growth. Instead, the long-term average GDP growth is determined by factors such as population growth, investment, and productivity. As an example, as the population increases people will demand more goods and services, which will drive GDP higher. If a country were to invest in education and machinery, the people that are working could increase their output per hour which would then increase GDP.</p>
<p>However, the central bank does control short-term interest rates, and also interest rates with longer investment horizons via different quantitative expansion and tightening programs. It’s via interest rates that the central banks such as the ECB or Federal Reserve can control the economy. If they opt to increase interest rates, then it will make loans and mortgages more expensive, and as most people have a mortgage, they would reduce their spending as the cost of the mortgage increases.</p>
<p>Individuals would also be reluctant to buy new items, such as cars if they need a loan to complete the purchase.</p>
<p>Why do Central Banks change its interest-rates depending on the GDP growth rate?</p>
<p>Most central banks have a mandate to keep annual inflation steady around 2%. An economy that is overheating, i.e. a GDP that is growing much faster than usual, will usually lead to high inflation, and also misallocated investments. To limit both problems, the central bank will usually increase interest rates if the GDP growing too fast, or if they project that GDP will be very high in the next two years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the economy is slowing down per GDP, or maybe the unemployment rate is starting to increase rapidly, the central bank will help households and companies by lowering interest rates. The central bank could also potentially introduce a quantitative easing program as they did in the great recession of 2008.</p>
<p>The lower interest rates would allow companies to make investments they would usually hesitate to take if interest rates where high. For households, mortgage costs would decline, but also other costs related to credit will be affected, such as car loans and student loans.</p>
<p><strong>Stock markets and GDP</strong></p>
<p>If GDP was growing from low levels, such as after a recession, and was projected to improve further in the year ahead then this would usually lead to a stronger stock market, as corporations would be expected to make more money and thereby increase their value.</p>
<p>However, a situation could arise where GDP is increasing too rapidly, this tends to be the case when interest rates are too low, and the central bank starts to worry about inflation. To combat any potential inflation in the future the central bank would start to increase interest rates. This would usually lower the profitability of companies causing stock markets to peak, and potentially decline if investors believe that there would be a recession.</p>
<p><strong>Forex Markets and GDP</strong></p>
<p>If GDP growth is running red-hot, and the central banks are increasing interest rates, that tends to cause its currency to increase in value. If the GDP growth is strong then that means that the country is becoming wealthier and tends to attract more investments. Foreigners would need to convert their currency to the domestic country’s currency if they would like to make an investment in the fast-growing country, therefore that would support the domestic currency. For example, if U.S. GDP is strong and a Euro investor wants to buy shares in an American company then they would need to convert their Euros to USD.</p>
<p>Strong GDP growth tends to naturally cause higher interest rates, as more people are interested in borrowing money to invest, and higher interest rates tend to translate into higher Forex swap rates. This could allow traders to profit on currency interest rate differentials. As an example, for decades Japanese interest rates have been low as Japanese GDP growth, and inflation has been anemic. This has caused Japanese investors to invest abroad in countries such as Australia, but also the United States where the return on their money is higher. This sort of trade is called the carry trade.</p>
