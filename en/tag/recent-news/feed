										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese EV shares dropped this week after BYD, a leading EV manufacturer, increased fears of a tough price war. The company&#8217;s aggressive price cuts have been rattling the sector, adding to fears over profitability and competition. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50725" style="width: 729px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50725" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NIO – Daily Chart" width="729" height="529" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart.png 729w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50725" class="wp-caption-text">NIO – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIO (NYSE:NIO) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were lower on the news with a move from the $4 level to prices under $3.80. This is a key level for the stock as a failure could move further down toward the $3 lows of April. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of Geely, Li Auto, and Xpeng saw declines of 7%, 5%, and 4% respectively, after BYD announced significant price reductions on 22 models, including the entry-level Seagull EV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price cuts are a strategic move by BYD to maintain its market leadership,&#8221; said analysts at Financial Times. &#8220;However, this aggressive pricing strategy could lead to a prolonged price war, affecting the entire industry&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a clear indication that the price war in the Chinese EV market is heating up,&#8221; said an analyst from South China Morning Post. &#8220;BYD&#8217;s move is likely to force other manufacturers to follow suit, leading to a potential race to the bottom&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price war raises concerns about the profitability of rival Chinese EV manufacturers, especially those that are targeted at higher-end consumers, such as NIO. BYD&#8217;s latest profit forecast fell short of analyst’s expectations, highlighting the challenges created by the intense competition in electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent setback, BYD was optimistic about its long-term prospects. In a statement released after the earnings, the company emphasized its commitment to innovation and market leadership. The latest price cuts by BYD may also be an effort to hit Tesla while it has already been struggling.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price war could lead to a shakeout in the Chinese EV market,&#8221; said an analyst from NBC Los Angeles. &#8220;Only the most competitive and innovative companies will be able to withstand the pressure&#8221;.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_50399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50399" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50399" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDUSD - Daily Chart" width="823" height="523" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart.png 823w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart-300x191.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50399" class="wp-caption-text">AUDUSD &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AUD v USD has recovered from the aggressive slump seen with the initial tariff shock in global markets. The 0.65 level is now resistance for further gains and price needs to hold above the 0.6360 level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommSec bank’s Tom Piotrowski said the consensus is that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s in terms of the markets’ pricing at least – there are some intellectual arguments that would hold different positions. But nonetheless, that’s what the markets are expecting,” he said on Sky News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reserve Bank of Australia could still surprise markets at its policy meeting on Tuesday, despite widespread expectations for a rate cut. With tariff issues increasing global uncertainty, predictions are varied, with some predicting a large cut, while others expect no move. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank’s rate decision will come at 12:30pm HKT, with the press conference set for 13:30pm. The Aussie dollar has gained with other global </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the Moody’s downgrade of US debt due to deficits and spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian economy is not in great health either, after recording almost the worst productivity performance in the developed world. The Productivity Commission is investigating whether the country&#8217;s 30% company tax rate should be lowered to drive higher productivity in the workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Treasury Scott Bessent played down the recent US debt downgrade, saying it was “a lagging indicator”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on CNN, he blamed the prior administration of Joe Biden. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t get here in the past 100 days,” he said. “It’s the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited, 6.7 percent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren’t in a recession, not in a war”.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong move for </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the weekend has the coin on course for a test of the highs above $109,000. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50348" style="width: 745px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50348" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BTCUSD – Daily Chart" width="745" height="540" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 745w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BTCUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50348" class="wp-caption-text">BTCUSD – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/bitcoin-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found strong support with the stock market as it tested the $76,768 level. The coin now looks to push for the $109,000 level this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move to new highs could come easily as talk of the bullish weekend could see </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors rushing to catch the trend. Bitmex founder Arthur Hayes has predicted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million before 2028. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new round of bullish price predictions could see investors trying to join the rally. Hayes believes that capital controls worldwide and US Treasury “devaluation” means that Bitcoin will become a popular safe haven for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of US Treasurys will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volume in this upmove has not been particularly strong and that could provide further fuel for a breakout this week. Credit ratings agency Moodys rattled the US dollar last week with a downgrade for the country’s debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing the debt rating from &#8216;AAA&#8217; to &#8216;Aa1&#8217;, Moody&#8217;s noted that successive US administrations had not done enough to tackle rising deficits and interest costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downgrade &#8220;reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,&#8221; a Moody&#8217;s statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could add to the safe haven theme and bring traders into the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week. </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US tech stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are around -4% lower from their previous highs and may look to close that gap this week. A move in risk-on assets would be another boost for Bitcoin as it looks to test the all-time highs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTI crude oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is trading at roughly $63.25 as of Wednesday&#8217;s Asian trading session, having risen due to decreased US-China trade tensions, which have lessened concerns of an economic recession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend in Switzerland, the US and China agreed to significant tariff reductions. US President Donald Trump agreed to lower additional tariffs on Chinese imports imposed in April of this year from 145% to 30%. In return, China will reduce duties on US imports from 125% to 10%. These lower tariff rates will be in effect for 90 days. This temporary reduction in tariffs between the world&#8217;s two largest oil consumers has the potential to boost the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API weekly report revealed a 4.287 million barrel increase in US crude oil stockpiles for the week ending May 9, contrary to the previous week&#8217;s 4.49 million barrel decrease and market expectations of a 2.4 million barrel drop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPEC+ is expected to increase oil exports in May and June, potentially limiting price increases. Since April, OPEC&#8217;s oil production has risen more than anticipated, with a projected daily increase of 411,000 barrels in May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Japan is expected to hold its key interest rate at 0.5% on Thursday but the press conference at 2:30pm HKT may bring more clarity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts will be keen to hear the latest thoughts of BOJ policy makers after their rate hike plans were delayed by tariffs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BOJ recently forecast a 1.1% gross domestic product for 2025 and 1% in 2026. Those figures could be revised amid the ongoing trade war, given that Japan is an export-dependent economy. The median outlook for consumer inflation is 2.4% and 2% over the same period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan&#8217;s Economy Minister, Ryosei Akazawa, repeated that they expect the complete removal of tariff levies. He added that he clarified that the government is not considering sacrificing agricultural products for the sake of automobiles in the negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said last week that the bank will continue to carefully monitor economic and price data in relation to its interest plans. Ueda’s comments will be studied at today’s press conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could boost the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US share markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week if tech earnings are positive and the economy shows some solid foundation after the recent turmoil. Traders may wait for the BOJ comments to apply more pressure on the US dollar after yesterday’s ADP Employment Change report said the private sector added 62K new job positions in April. That was lower than the 108K anticipated by market participants. The preliminary estimate of Q1 GDP also missed expectations, as the economy contracted at an annualized pace of 0.3% against the anticipated 0.4% expansion.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US tech giant </span><b>Apple (NYSE:AAPL)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the latest company to release </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48775" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48775" style="width: 991px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48775" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="991" height="568" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png 991w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-768x440.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48775" class="wp-caption-text">AAPL – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAPL shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have cleared the $195.77 level which was supported back in August 2024. The stock now looks to close a gap open at $221.42. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple earnings will be released after the US stock market closes on Thursday. Investors will be watching for clues on how shifting trade policies could impact the iPhone maker. Bank of America recently reiterated its “buy” rating, but lowered their price target to $240 from $250. The bank’s analysts noted &#8220;uncertainty in the economic outlook.&#8221; The analysts said that Apple could see some near-term upside &#8220;driven by some pull forward of demand&#8221; caused by tariff fears, but warned that demand could weaken with consumer strain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several analysts have warned the company could be hurt by a trade war with China, where Apple relies on overseas manufacturers for an estimated 90% of its products. To help mitigate some of that risk, Apple is reportedly planning to move the assembly of all iPhones it sells in the US to India by the end of 2026.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Apple to report second-quarter revenue of $94.66 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and net income of $24.45 billion, or $1.62 per share, up from $23.64 billion, from a year earlier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple shipped millions of units of its iPhone to the United States ahead of the tariffs and that could boost the earnings outlook in the near-term. An upbeat assessment from management could boost the share price after some solid earnings from rival tech firms such as <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/meta-platforms-join-q1-tech-earnings-parade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a> and <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/market-news/microsoft-earnings-focus-cloud-ai-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Meta Platforms (NYSE: META)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the latest tech company to release its </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q1 earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48706 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/META-Daily-Chart.png" alt="META - Daily Chart" width="925" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/META-Daily-Chart.png 925w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/META-Daily-Chart-300x181.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/META-Daily-Chart-768x464.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">META &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of META is mirroring other </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a slump in 2025, finding key support. This could mark a technical correction in the price of technology stocks and investors can compare the releases to see which company surprised the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta has launched a standalone ChatGPT competitor on Tuesday, making its most direct move to compete with Microsoft. The app has been built on Meta’s llama models and features on AI assistant and image generation, similar to recent roll-outs from Google’s Gemini and xAI’s Grok. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta’s financial results are released after the market closes on Wednesday and they will be closely watched to see how effectively the company is spending its $60-65bn AI infrastructure investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect the company to post $5.21 in earnings per share with $41.2bn in revenue, marking a 13% increase from a year ago.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next issue is tariffs and the impact on Meta’s advertising spend income. May 2 brings the end to an exemption that has shielded companies like Temu and Shein from rising costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Second-half visibility is murky, and the tariff shift may only amplify uncertainty”, said CFRA’s Angelo Zino. Other analysts believe Meta’s scale will buffer any slowdown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Meta is more resilient than peers”, said Baird’s Ted Mortonson, highlighting the company’s 3.4bn monthly users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta has managed to beat EPS estimates four quarters in a row and any uptick in monetisation of generative AI could boost the stock. On Wall St, 88% of analysts rate the stock a buy with a price target of around $707 on average.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Amazon (NYSE:AMZN) shares</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have first-quarter </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released this week and are looking to secure a recent price low.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48662" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48662" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AMZN – Daily Chart" width="865" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.png 865w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48662" class="wp-caption-text">AMZN – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMZN is trading at $187.70 and the price has cleared a significant gap that occurred in August last year. The stock can see this as a base for further gains if the earnings are positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big issue for Amazon in the coming quarters is a tariff threat to profit margins. As tariffs were reduced to a 10% flat rate, that can still eat into the company’s profit share on all of its products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer cut its price target on the company by 15%, based on the tariff threat. Analysts revised their relatively bullish target price from $260 to $220. The company still has an outperform rating on the e-commerce firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley analysts said recently that around 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, while roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have &#8220;some China exposure&#8221; that could affect advertising spending plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite tariffs, they expect investors to be pleased with mid- to high-teens growth at AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing platform, “even if margins contract meaningfully” on the e-commerce side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Amazon to report around $155 billion in revenue on Thursday, up 8% year-over-year, according to consensus estimates. Profits are expected to be $14.7 billion, up 41% from a year ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic reports released this week will also be important to the outlook for Amazon shares. GDP growth figures will be released on Thursday for the US and the important </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/financial-events/non-farm-payroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFP non farm payrolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data will come late on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could boost the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US share markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week if tech earnings are positive and the economy shows some solid foundation after the recent turmoil.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">MSFT-–-Daily-Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSFT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price now trades at $391.16 after finding some strong support at $350 recently. This aligns well with a double bottom formation from 2024 and could see further gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft releases earnings on Wednesday, and although the business may not be too exposed to the risk of tariffs, analysts are still concerned about economic uncertainty. Many businesses that drive revenue at the tech giant are becoming more cautious in their spending on cloud computing and AI services, analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend is expected to hurt key Microsoft products such as the Azure cloud platform, Microsoft 365 enterprise subscriptions, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Overall, analysts expect to see revenue of $68.44 billion, up 11% from a year earlier, and earnings of $3.22 per share. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley recently cut its forecast for Azure growth to 31% for the March quarter, down from an earlier prediction of 31.5%. The firm added that businesses are being more cautious about new Azure subscriptions, and warned of slower growth ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said interest in the Copilot AI assistant remains strong, but many customers are looking for further reasons to boost adoption, with discounts as high as 40%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Interest remains very high, but increasingly customers are using financial operations teams and searching for business cases to justify the product,” analysts wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedbush analysts lowered their price target to $475 from $550, but said they &#8220;remain long term bullish&#8221; on Microsoft, due to its AI upside. &#8220;It has become crystal clear to us that the monetization opportunities around deploying AI in the cloud is a transformational opportunity,&#8221; they said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock price is in good shape for a return to the bullish stance if the earnings are positive and the market remains stable.</span></p>
