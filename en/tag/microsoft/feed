										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Microsoft (NYSE:MSFT)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will release its latest </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday and analysts will be looking for cracks in AI and cloud growth. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48690" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="MSFT-–-Daily-Chart" width="901" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.webp 901w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-300x190.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-768x487.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MSFT-–-Daily-Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSFT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price now trades at $391.16 after finding some strong support at $350 recently. This aligns well with a double bottom formation from 2024 and could see further gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft releases earnings on Wednesday, and although the business may not be too exposed to the risk of tariffs, analysts are still concerned about economic uncertainty. Many businesses that drive revenue at the tech giant are becoming more cautious in their spending on cloud computing and AI services, analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend is expected to hurt key Microsoft products such as the Azure cloud platform, Microsoft 365 enterprise subscriptions, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Overall, analysts expect to see revenue of $68.44 billion, up 11% from a year earlier, and earnings of $3.22 per share. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley recently cut its forecast for Azure growth to 31% for the March quarter, down from an earlier prediction of 31.5%. The firm added that businesses are being more cautious about new Azure subscriptions, and warned of slower growth ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said interest in the Copilot AI assistant remains strong, but many customers are looking for further reasons to boost adoption, with discounts as high as 40%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Interest remains very high, but increasingly customers are using financial operations teams and searching for business cases to justify the product,” analysts wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedbush analysts lowered their price target to $475 from $550, but said they &#8220;remain long term bullish&#8221; on Microsoft, due to its AI upside. &#8220;It has become crystal clear to us that the monetization opportunities around deploying AI in the cloud is a transformational opportunity,&#8221; they said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock price is in good shape for a return to the bullish stance if the earnings are positive and the market remains stable.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft (MSFT) shares</a> are in focus as the company is the latest tech giant to release its earnings report.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42233" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MSFT-Daily-Chart.png" alt="MSFT - Daily Chart" width="789" height="597" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MSFT-Daily-Chart.png 789w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MSFT-Daily-Chart-300x227.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MSFT-Daily-Chart-768x581.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MSFT &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of MSFT is testing the $430 level and that has been a pivot area for the stock since March. A strong earnings report could see the price jump above that level and test the $440 area, while there is support down to $410.</p>
<p>Microsoft shares have slipped from a July high near $470 as investors wound back their expectations for artificial intelligence revenue streams. Microsoft’s earnings will be similar to Alphabet’s, where investors want to see further cloud growth and also the level of spending that the company has committed to.</p>
<p>Microsoft is now the third-largest company in the world, with a market valuation of $3.18 trillion, after Nvidia soared to number one. The company’s June earnings were disappointing after cloud growth slowed down.</p>
<p>In the upcoming <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings report</a> which is released after the market close on Wednesday, investors will again look for the cloud growth outlook. The Azure segment has been a key driver of revenue for the company. Another focus will be the company’s spending on its data centre infrastructure. Analysts are worried that rising capital expenditure could hurt profit margins.</p>
<p>Azure and other cloud services now account for nearly 60% of the company’s total revenue, making it critical to future growth. Azure ranks second in global market share, behind Amazon Web Services. Google is in third and will also release its earnings report this week, which could highlight competition.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024, Microsoft’s Cloud segment reported revenue of $28.51 billion, for an increase of 19% year-on-year. That was driven by a 29% growth in Azure and other cloud products. However, Azure&#8217;s growth fell short of analysts&#8217; expectations in the quarter.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank analysts said they expect Azure to post a low-to-mid 30s percentage increase for the fiscal first quarter, saying the company “needs to deliver Azure outperformance and guidance for little if any deceleration”.</p>
<p>Microsoft management has said that increased investment in data centres are needed to meet a fast-growing demand for AI training. In the forward-looking statements of the June quarter, the tech giant acknowledged &#8220;significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns,&#8221; after an extra $3 billion was spent compared to the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Microsoft will need to see a rebound in its upcoming earnings release if the share price is to return to its March highs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft will release earnings after the market closes on Thursday. The support levels are well-defined if earnings are slower than expected. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32568" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="MSFT – Daily Chart" width="919" height="600" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.png 919w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-300x196.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-768x501.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">MSFT – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSFT has support levels under $400 to around $396. The upside stalled on Wednesday at $412. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big story will be Microsoft&#8217;s traction in gaining AI-related subscribers to its Copilot tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect a year-over-year increase in the top and bottom lines, with earnings per share of $2.84 on revenues of $60.89 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street will closely watch the tech giant&#8217;s AI adoption, with analysts at Wedbush calling it Microsoft&#8217;s (MSFT) &#8220;iPhone Moment&#8221;. Microsoft has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI and other tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased adoption of generative AI tools is expected to drive more dollars to the company&#8217;s Azure cloud business, which Wedbush expects will show 30% growth over the quarter. The analysts believe that more companies will utilise generative AI tools and Copilot, adding to Azure cloud deals. They said AI use cases will likely &#8220;explode across the enterprise landscape&#8221; over the next six months to a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That remains to be seen, and Microsoft&#8217;s earnings will be essential on Thursday. Analysts at Cit expect AI-related revenue to surprise the upside during the third-quarter earnings. Shares of the software giant are up more than 8% year-to-date, with the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up 6%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three months, the company has seen substantial revisions to its estimates. Its earnings per share estimates have been revised 27 times vs. one downward revision. In contrast, its revenue estimates have seen 15 upward moves compared to 18 downward revisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earnings are more critical because Meta releases on Wednesday evening and Alphabet releases alongside Microsoft, so the AI growth expectations will be tested into the end of the week and will be vital for the path of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29466 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="MSFT – Daily Chart" width="927" height="537" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 927w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x174.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x445.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">MSFT – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSFT found support at the July 2023 highs and soared again in 2024. However, earnings could threaten the rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The computing and software giant’s stock price has soared dramatically since January 2023, but the AI hype will need to deliver. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI gains have come for semiconductor companies as they supply corporate demand for AI platforms. But those platforms must show consumer demand. Microsoft’s ChatGPT and Copilot tools will be necessary in the coming earnings release.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSFT’s second-quarter fiscal 2024 results are set for release </span><b>on January 30</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the US market closes, and analysts will again look at consistent cloud growth. For the company’s fiscal second quarter, analysts expect Intelligent Cloud revenues of between $21.5 billion and $25.4 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft has benefited from continued demand for cloud infrastructure, web-based applications, and human resources solutions. Many firms have shifted their workloads to the cloud. However, macroeconomic shifts can hurt spending, and the current stock price remains elevated and lined up for a correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its Azure cloud platform, Microsoft expects revenue growth of 26-27%, with increasing contributions from AI. However, continued lofty projections are at risk if analysts see a sign of slowing growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other issue will be the demand for the company’s premium version of the Copilot AI assistant. That was priced at </span><b>$30 per month</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and demand may be weak at that price tag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft’s leadership in the AI rally could mean that a </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sell-off comes with disappointing earnings. At the same time, the reverse is likely to be the case for more robust earnings.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Microsoft will release its latest earnings next week, which will likely be the driver of tech stocks for the quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28638" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="MSFT – Daily Chart" width="1057" height="565" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.png 1057w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-300x160.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-1024x547.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1057px) 100vw, 1057px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 10pt">MSFT – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">MSFT shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> soared in 2023 from $219 to around $390 now. The support seen at $366 will provide support again. For traders, any negativity on AI adoption could see a sharp pullback. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The year 2023 was full of AI hype that propelled tech stocks higher, but that now leaves them vulnerable. The life-changing predictions of ChatGPT and other tools have cooled down in recent months. That leaves tech stocks vulnerable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the critical drivers for Microsoft and the tech sector will be the company&#8217;s Copilot subscription. The tool was set to be a premium subscription for its 365 business productivity suite, and that will need to see a strong uptake in users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The big problem is that many companies were given lofty valuations for AI. However, much of that was driven by </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/market-news/nvidia-earnings-guide-tech-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nvidia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The company&#8217;s chips were in demand last year by companies seeking to test and build new AI tools. But they will still need to find a winning formula. The AI boom of last year is at risk in the coming earnings season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Traders will again focus on the growth of Microsoft&#8217;s cloud business as a vital component of the earnings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One analyst who is always bullish on tech is Dan Ives of Wedbush, who sees a positive outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We believe the key narrative for 4Q earnings season is the beginning of the AI Revolution hitting the shores of the broader tech landscape&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ives believes massive consumer spending and demand are pouring into AI&#8217;s second, third, and fourth derivatives across software, chips, and hardware. He says AI technology is gaining momentum in the mainstream, and he expects that to create further growth and new products. Ives added that a strong &#8220;year-end budget flush&#8221; will give cloud giants Microsoft, Amazon, and Google room to commit to further R&amp;D or ventures.</span></p>

The tech giant announced it was incorporating the company’s ChatGPT software into its Bing search engine, and that led to a big push among rival firms to catch up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Late on Friday, OpenAI shocked the market with news that it had fired its CEO and co-founder Sam Altman. The early press release said he had been “less than candid” with other board members. On Saturday, rumours circulated that the board sought to reinstate the entrepreneur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reports also said that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was “furious” at the change.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever happens next shows instability at a company that Microsoft had invested much time and money into. Nadella’s firm recently launched a $30 per month premium version of its 365 business productivity suite and other institutional efforts are expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no real threat to Microsoft, and the billions committed to OpenAI are safe. However, it is not ideal that there is now a culture of instability at AI firms, especially when companies like Google seek to run their AI tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Traders should monitor MSFT in the pre-market and any effects on the futures market in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nasdaq tech index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Some profit-taking may emerge in the stock.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSFT (Daily Chart)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft beat analysts’ expectations with Q1 revenue up 13% to $56.52 billion, $2 billion more than Wall Street expected. Q1 earnings per share were up 27% to $2.99, 35 cents per share above expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big news was growth in the Intelligent Cloud segment, up 19% to $24.26 billion. Management also guided growth of 26 to 27% in forward guidance for Azure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first growth in cloud since Q3 2022 and bodes well for the company’s AI plans. Microsoft saw growth in its delivery of packages such as 365 and has the $30 per month AI-driven Copilot tool coming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers,” Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Satya Nadella said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts at Jeffries said Microsoft could take cloud business from Amazon, and they also see Microsoft gaining ground ahead of Google in the AI race. While the two beat Wall Street’s expectations on top- and bottom-line results, Microsoft was the clear winner. Google reported slower-than-anticipated growth in its cloud business, despite diverting a lot of cash to its AI efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what this is telling us is that Microsoft is absolutely in a league of its own when it comes to enterprise software when it comes to tech,” RBC Capital Markets equity analyst Rishi Jaluria told Yahoo Finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an unparalleled year for Microsoft. Who would have thought if we were having this conversation a year ago and I were to tell you, &#8216;Hey, Microsoft is the leader in big tech AI, not Google,’ you probably would have laughed at me and told me to get off of your show?&#8221; Jaluria added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-25053 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/msft-chart-1-300x200.png" alt="msft chart" width="666" height="444" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/msft-chart-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/msft-chart-1-768x511.png 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/msft-chart-1.png 798w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">MSFT: Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">MSFT shares have still struggled since hitting a top near $350 and now trade at $326. Continued weakness in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">stock indices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px"> is a threat, but the downside has been limited, and earnings could spur a further advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">Citi analyst Tyler Radke sees the company accelerating total revenue and profitability due to stronger IT budget trends and new generative AI revenue streams. Radke said eyes will be on the company’s Azure cloud growth and the new AI tool Copilot, where strong early adoption trends are tipped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">Radke also updated his estimates for Activision with signs of stabilisation in cloud spending, which are offset by some small FX headwinds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">The analyst predicts year-on-year growth of 26% for Azure, which is a high bar and could hurt Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">Investors are also considering the impact of the recent $1 billion deal with cloud computing giant Amazon. Amazon is said to be deploying Microsoft 365 tools across its workforce, and Amazon will pay $1 billion over five years to Microsoft for the licences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">One of the key indicators for the stock will be the Copilot AI assistant tools, which were priced at $30 per month. Google has since launched a rival product with the same price tag for its own productivity tools, so the two companies will battle it out for dominance in the new sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">KeyBanc analyst Michael Turits keeps an overweight rating on Microsoft with a price target of $400. The analyst increased his outlook ahead of Q1 earnings following stable results in Q3 and better feedback on Azure from a few large channels, including the AI contribution to Azure growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">Some analysts fear that Microsoft is still valued at a premium to its tech peers, and if the company does not show strong AI progress, then there could be some downside to the stock price that could hurt other AI stocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px">Nasdaq tech index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;line-height: 2.5;margin-bottom: 20px"> closed around the September lows and could see a bounce early in the week. With strong earnings from Microsoft, the shares could head for the $350 highs, but weaker-than-expected AI would be a negative.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="line-height: 2">Microsoft has made a three-day rebound in price after a recent downtrend and seeks to push to resistance.</p>
<p><span id="more-24431"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><span style="font-size: 12px;color: #000000"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/MSFT%20Weekly%20Chart.png" width="816" height="572" loading="lazy" alt="MSFT: Weekly Chart" style="width: 816px;height: auto;max-width: 100%;margin: 10px auto"></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: center;line-height: 1">MSFT: Weekly Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The price of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft stock</a><span>&nbsp;</span>trades at $334.27 after recently hitting highs near $370.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">The price action of the stock is important because it has been a beneficiary of the AI hype this year, which some are starting to question.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;We are still in the relatively early stages&#8221; of a new tech cycle, said Jay Jacobs, BlackRock US Head of Thematic and Active Equity ETFs.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Jacobs said, &#8220;This is a $15 to $20 trillion theme over the coming decades. This is going to massively upend several aspects of the economy. Not just technology, but if we look at health care, if we look at services, if we look at productivity, it&#8217;s going to have a really incredible impact.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">In a recent report titled, &#8220;Why AI is not a bubble?&#8221;, the Goldman analyst disputes any signs of this trend popping, saying, quote, &#8220;We believe we are still in the relatively early stages of a new technology cycle that&#8217;s likely to lead to further outperformance.&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;The big takeaway here is that most of the AI stock market moves this year have been really concentrated in just a few names, some of these mega-cap tech names that, to be fair, are massive platforms and really some of the pioneers in the space,&#8221; Jacobs said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">But after seeing early hype and adjustments to market valuations, some companies are struggling to see gains. Shares in C3.ai fell on Thursday after the software maker reduced its target to turn into a profitable company by the fourth quarter of this fiscal year amid growing investments in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;Q1 results do not suggest that C3 is benefiting from growing demand for AI. Metrics such as average total contract value and a largely unchanged fiscal 2024 revenue outlook do not point to any meaningful AI tailwinds either,&#8221; BofA’s Brad Sills said to clients.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">At Deutsche Bank, Brad Zelnick said in his note to clients: &#8220;C3.ai reported fiscal Q1 results that are unlikely to quell concerns about customer traction and commitments, the path to profitability, steady state margins of the business ex-Baker Hughes, and the level of generative AI monetization on its platform relative to management&#8217;s very bullish commentary.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">For the likes of Microsoft, analysts are also looking to see if there is any traction on earnings beyond chipmakers like Nvidia in the early stages.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 16px;line-height: 1">MSFT: Weekly Chart</p>
<p style="line-height: 2"><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">Microsoft stock</a><span>&nbsp;</span>hit an all-time high this week above $360 and retraced back under the 2021 high. There is now potential to drop back to the $300 level.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">&#8220;We believe this is one of the most important earnings weeks for the tech sector in many years,&#8221; said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. &#8220;With tech stocks showing a robust performance through the first half of 2023, now the Street needs to see what this AI Revolution holds for the tech sector heading into the rest of 2023 and 2024.&#8221;</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Investors will be looking for signs that Microsoft’s artificial intelligence investments are on track to boost earnings. It is likely that Wall Street is ahead of itself in pricing the potential for AI.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Microsoft’s Copilot platform was given a premium pricing model, but that may not boost revenue in comparison to its current valuation. The company is also incorporating AI into its other products, including Bing, GitHub, and Azure Cloud.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">Earnings season started last week for the second quarter, and Microsoft will report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on July 25. Continued strength in the company’s cloud business is expected, and that has been a big supporter of the company’s rise to an<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/en/analysis/market-news/microsoft-stock-all-time-high" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">all-time high</a>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">For the recent quarter, Microsoft expects its revenue in the Productivity and Business processes segment to improve by 10% to $17.9–$18.2 billion. A slower figure and a lack of AI progress could hurt the company’s stock price.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2">After a big year for artificial intelligence and tech stocks, the coming earnings season could derail the big valuations if the revenue addition is seen to be slow.</p>
