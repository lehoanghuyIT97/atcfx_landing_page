										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/earning-season-calendar">MSFT</a>: A new rival to ChatGPT will add focus to Microsoft’s earnings on 29 Jan 2025.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-45399 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/msft-daily-chart-20250128.png" alt="msft-mircosoft-daily-chart-20250128" width="903" height="544" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/msft-daily-chart-20250128.png 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/msft-daily-chart-20250128-300x181.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/msft-daily-chart-20250128-768x463.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MSFT – Daily Chart</p>
<p>MSFT lost more than -3% on Monday with the stock below $30. The dip buyers saved it for now but there is risk of a move lower with earnings.</p>
<p>Microsoft releases its latest earnings on Wednesday after the market closes and there is now risk to the downside with the arrival of China’s DeepSeek AI tool. A clear threat to ChatGPT, investors will now put extra focus on MSFT earnings this week and could punish the stock with any negatives.</p>
<p>One issue the market may have is any sign of increased AI spending from Microsoft. Investors may also look for references to ChatGPT after a cheaper and more accurate model has emerged. Tech companies have been given high valuations on the belief that AI revenue was coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>That is now at risk and stocks could get hurt after the big spending on chips and data centers from Big Tech.</p>
<p>“Investor sentiment has shifted negative as a ‘wall of worry&#8217; around gross margins, capex, GenAI monetization and the OpenAI relationship builds,” Morgan Stanley analysts said. They also noted that Microsoft has underperformed other large-cap software firms over the last quarter.</p>
<p>Wall Street expects Microsoft to deliver revenue of $68.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year; with earnings of $23.36 billion, up from $21.87 billion. Revenue from Microsoft&#8217;s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure cloud computing platform, is expected to climb 20% to $25.76 billion.</p>
<p>However, markets may see a drop in cloud spending coming if the DeepSeek app becomes the most popular application for AI. Microsoft wrote in its blog that it was expecting a &#8220;new, large Azure commitment&#8221; from OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, but that was before this week’s news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The emergence of a new artificial intelligence tool in China.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-45397 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nas100-daily-chart-20250128.png" alt="daily-market-news" width="879" height="511" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nas100-daily-chart-20250128.png 879w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nas100-daily-chart-20250128-300x174.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nas100-daily-chart-20250128-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100">NAS 100</a> has slumped to test the previous all-time high from July. Dip buyers emerged early and that will be the key barrier to avoid a move lower toward the 18,500 mark. A new application has topped Apple’s app store this week and rattled the U.S stock market. DeepSeek, an AI app developed by a Chinese hedge fund manager, has beaten ChatGPT to the top spot.</p>
<p>The performance figures of DeepSeek, and the R1 AI model that supports its chatbot, has investors questioning the dominance of the West in the new technology. The news comes after U.S. venture Stargate said it would spend as much as $500 billion on AI infrastructure over the next four years. Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as &#8220;AI&#8217;s Sputnik moment,&#8221; a reference to the start of the Space Race.</p>
<p>“They were super-efficient in building the model. Instead of using some 16,000 chips to train the chatbot, they used 2,000. That’s impressive. Silicon Valley must be in a panic,” said an AI philosopher at the University of Oxford in England.</p>
<p>The success of DeepSeek which is now a real threat to its American competitors has surprised many. The belief had been that bigger was better in order to train an AI syste, and the latest tool must call into question the huge CAPEX spend that U.S. tech firms have committed to in AI chips and data centers. It is also a threat to companies such as Nvidia.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 lost more than 2% in early trading before dip buyers emerged. Market heavyweight Nvidia was an early loser, down more than 12%. Companies such as Oracle are also lower at -8%. Both of those companies were beneficiaries of demand for data centers and chips.</p>
<p>There is a real risk of further correction in the tech market this week as investment firms will be racing to adjust their analysis for valuations in the chipmaker stocks.</p>
