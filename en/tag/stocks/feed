										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla (NYSE: TSLA)</a> has mounted a two-day rally following its better-than-expected <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings release</a>.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-42132 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="TSLA - Daily Chart" width="783" height="613" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart.jpg 783w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart-300x235.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart-768x601.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">TSLA &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of TSLA rose sharply on Thursday after the post-market earnings release a day before. The resistance at $265 has been surpassed, and another target at the July 2023 high is around $300.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s earnings provided positive commentary for short-and-long-term during the Q3 earnings call, with 2024 deliveries set to rise on a yearly basis. That would require a strong quarter in Q4 as the first nine months have lagged the prior year. An important takeaway was that Elon Musk said that Tesla&#8217;s deliveries could grow as much as 30% next year, which is twice what Wall Street had predicted.</p>
<p>Revenues of Tesla&#8217;s Energy business also rose sharply by more than 50% year-on-year and now contribute 10% of total revenue. Tesla&#8217;s $739 million regulatory credit income during Q3 was its second-highest ever.</p>
<p>These revenues go largely to gross profits and could remain strong as other automakers scale back their EV growth plans, and they would need to buy these credits from companies like Tesla.</p>
<p>Management said the company is on track to deliver a low-cost model next year, with Cybercab mass production expected in 2026. Musk also said the company is aiming to sell at least 2 million Cybercabs annually.</p>
<p>Musk was also still positive on the delayed roll-out of full self-driving, saying, &#8220;Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter.&#8221; The new target is &#8220;next year,&#8221; and he added that &#8220;there&#8217;s no need to wait for robotaxi or Cybercab to experience full autonomy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla is also looking to start a ride-hailing service in Texas and California in 2025, which had a negative effect on Uber shares.</p>
<p>Analyst Gene Munster said Tesla&#8217;s earnings had something for both short-term and long-term investors. He sees the strong Q3 profitability and guidance on Q4 and 2025 deliveries as benefits in the short term.</p>
<p>Munster added: &#8220;The long-term investors got the golden carrot.&#8221; He thinks Musk&#8217;s comments on Cybercab deliveries, which could rise to 4 million units annually, as a key positive for long-term investors.</p>
<p>A key issue now could be the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/financial-events/us-presidential-election-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US election</a>, as Musk has supported Donald Trump and would likely see that return with beneficial trading conditions. Musk has publicly stated that he would be targeted by a Kamala Harris administration due to his outspoken views and his purchase of the Twitter app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chipmaker Micron (NYSE: MU) is set to release its latest <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40970 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MU-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="MU - Daily Chart" width="699" height="624" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MU-Daily-Chart.webp 699w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MU-Daily-Chart-300x268.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MU &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of MU is trading close to the 2022 high of around $97.62. That will be the key price with the earnings release after the stock slumps in recent months.</p>
<p>Micron Technology has many analysts who are pessimistic about the chip maker&#8217;s management guidance for coming quarters. However, a Citi analyst still placed a Buy rating on the stock.</p>
<p>Citi analyst Christopher Danely wrote in a research note last week that he spent time chatting with investors about their expectations for Micron&#8217;s earnings, which he said were very pessimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate roughly 80% of investors are bearish on Micron, with every hedge fund we spoke with being negative and a few mutual funds being positive,&#8221; Danely wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shares</a> of Micron are up 4.7% this year, but they have recently taken a tumble. The stock is currently down around 40%, an all-time closing high of $153.45 in June. The shift in investor sentiment came after broader semiconductor stocks weakened as investors rotated their money away from technology stocks, competition increased in the sector, and geopolitical tensions increased.</p>
<p>The PHLX Semiconductor Index has dropped 14% from its 2024 closing high of 5,904.54 in July.</p>
<p>Other analysts have also recently come up with more pessimistic commentary regarding Micron. BNP Paribas analyst Karl Ackerman downgraded shares to Underperform from Outperform and slashed his price target to $67 from $140. He expects Micron to underperform compared to the sector in artificial-intelligence semiconductors through 2025. Ackerman said an oversupply of high bandwidth memory, or HBMs, would push down the average selling prices of the company&#8217;s memory chips.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley analysts lowered their price target on Micron to $100 from $140 while maintaining Equal Weight. They also questioned Micron&#8217;s average selling price growth in the fourth and first quarters and expected the stock to &#8220;continue trading poorly unless that shows signs of reversing&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, they are still bullish on the stock, which trades 9.6 times earnings, significantly below its five-year average of 21 times. They said that the cheap valuation and the potential of increased AI demand for Micron&#8217;s products over time are reasons to buy the stock.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40263 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AVGO-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="AVGO – Daily Chart" width="727" height="634" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AVGO-–-Daily-Chart.webp 727w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AVGO-–-Daily-Chart-300x262.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">AVGO – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of AVGO now trades at $152.79 and is down sharply from the June highs. There is now a risk of further weakness to the $128.78 level. Positive earnings could support the stock for another move higher.</p>
<p>Semiconductor firm Broadcom&#8217;s latest results will be released Thursday after the closing bell and will be one of the week&#8217;s most anticipated events. Broadcom stock is up around 40% this year, and analysts are positive about the earnings.</p>
<p>According to recent data, 12 of the 13 analysts covering Broadcom have &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the company. The average price target on the firm is $192.96, roughly 19% higher than Friday&#8217;s close price. However, the stock dropped on Tuesday, causing weakness in the broader sector.</p>
<p>Broadcom conducted a 10-for-1 share split this year and has continued to impress with its AI-related goals.</p>
<p>Broadcom has been a key customer for Apple in recent years despite the iPhone maker developing its chips. Cisco Systems and Comcast are among the names of its other customers.</p>
<p>The latest earnings report will come after <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/market-news/chip-stocks-wobble-after-nvidia-shares-dip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia shares disappointed</a> the market, and we could see the market react to the strength of AVGO revenue growth. Traders will be looking for chip stocks to stabilize, and the release could add further jitters to the sector if it misses estimates on growth or management guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/largest-stock-exchanges-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global stock markets</a> plunged, and bond prices surged on Monday. Growing concerns about a potential US recession drove investors to flee risky assets and bet on rapid interest rate cuts to support economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US stock futures fall sharply: <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq</a> futures down 2.27%, <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> futures drop 1.41%</li>
<li>Asian markets hit hard: Japan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikkei</a> sheds 5.5%, hitting seven-month lows</li>
<li>Treasury yields plummet: 10-year yield falls to 3.723%, lowest since mid-2023</li>
<li>Markets price in aggressive Fed rate cuts: 70% chance of 50 basis point cut in September</li>
</ul>
<p>The sell-off was particularly severe in Asia, with Japan&#8217;s Nikkei index experiencing its largest three session loss since the 2011 financial crisis. The MSCI&#8217;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2.0%, while European futures also pointed to a lower open.</p>
<p>Bond markets saw a significant rally, with the 10-year US <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/market-snapshot/daily-market-snapshot-2-august-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treasury note yield dropping</a> to 3.723%, its lowest level since mid-2023. The move reflects growing expectations of aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10 percentage points to 25%,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts noted, adjusting their forecast to include quarter-point rate cuts in September, November, and December.</p>
<p>JPMorgan took an even more bearish stance, assigning a 50% probability to a US recession and predicting a 50 basis point cut at the September and November Fed meetings.</p>
<p>Currency markets reacted to the shifting interest rate landscape, with the US dollar weakening against major currencies. The euro held firm at $1.0920, while the Japanese yen strengthened to 144.99 against the dollar.</p>
<p>Oil prices rebounded slightly in commodities from eight-month lows, with Brent crude gaining 27 cents to $77.08 a barrel. However, concerns about demand continue to weigh on the market.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rocketed higher at the open but have since fallen back to a gain of around 50%. The price was rejected at the $11.17 resistance, but traders should keep an eye on any support that emerges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from J.P. Morgan, GameStop and AMC shares were the most traded by retail investors on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Roaring Kitty&#8221;, a social media character created by Keith Gill, was a key architect of the meme stock frenzy in 2021. Gill returned to X after three years away.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GameStop surged as much as 118% on Monday, but the shares surged another 100% in pre-market trading and were up X on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC also surged 78% to $5.19. The world&#8217;s largest theatre chain more than doubled from a record low it hit in mid-April. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other names were also boosted, with Blackberry up 27% and gains in Reddit. Solar stocks were boosted on Tuesday, but some have heavy short positions and could also see attention from retail crowding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GameStop shares soared again, reaching highs not seen since the meme stock environment of 2021. However, the price tailed back to show gains of around 35%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still need to hear the end of these moves. Gill has yet to mention any specific stock name on X. It is possible that he does not even support GME and AMC at this time. There could be activity in other stocks.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earnings season</a> for the largest semiconductor firms was able to hold a rebound after earnings beat expectations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33150 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOXX-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="SOXX – Daily Chart" width="903" height="629" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOXX-–-Daily-Chart.webp 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOXX-–-Daily-Chart-300x209.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOXX-–-Daily-Chart-768x535.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SOXX – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of SOXX saw a sharp breakdown, which took out an uptrend support line. The price is now testing $219-220, with the previous highs at $240.</p>
<p>Arm Holdings&#8217; full-year revenue forecast on Wednesday missed investors&#8217; expectations. The company had soared from its September IPO as a chip designer to the largest semiconductor firm. Shares of Arm fell 7% in after-hours trading in the U.S.</p>
<p>The semiconductor sector was booming on AI optimism but slipped last month on growing concerns about the long-term demand outlook for chips and weak demand from China. There were weaker earnings from Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Super Micro Computer, but the market is bidding the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stocks</a> with other tech sectors.</p>
<p>AMD delivered gloomy guidance for 2024 sales of its newly released AI chip, which pushed the stock down 9%. Although the company did raise its revenue target for the MI300 line to at least $4 billion from $3.5 billion. Wall Street was looking for a bigger boost, and around 12 analysts cut their price targets on AMD.</p>
<p>Super Micro Computer plunged 14% following its revenue miss due to concerns over the profitability of a new line of servers. However, some analysts raised the target price on the stock because AI demand is still in the early stages and will continue to grow.</p>
<p>The largest holdings in the SOXX index are Nvidia and Broadcom, which were up 6.27% and 3.7%, respectively, over the last week. Another top holding is Qualcomm, which is up almost 10% over that period.</p>
<p>The outlook for the index is good if those large holdings can keep gaining, but this earnings season has raised some alarm bells about the pace of demand.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">XIAOMI – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>Xiaomi has been on an uptrend this year, which can continue to the 20.00 level.</p>
<p>The Chinese tech giant has now unveiled the SU7, a new battery-powered luxury vehicle, with the company&#8217;s CEO saying it will target Tesla in the world&#8217;s largest EV market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Xiaomi&#8217;s goal is to make a dream car that is as good as Porsche and Tesla,&#8221; said billionaire CEO and co-founder Lei Jun. Lei did not confirm the price of the SU7, which launches next year and is intended to compete with luxury electric vehicles like the Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan Turbo.</p>
<p>Xiaomi, founded in 2010, said it would invest $10 billion in EV production in 2021. The company is best known for producing smartphones cheaper than Apple or Samsung devices. According to data from Counterpoint Research, the company&#8217;s smartphones are the third most popular globally, with a 14% market share.</p>
<p>The company is now seeking to become a significant global carmaker within the next few decades, with Lei saying it will be the &#8220;final major entrepreneurial project&#8221; of his life.</p>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s arrival in the highly competitive Chinese EV market will add to the growing pressure on Tesla from domestic carmakers in the country. Elon Musk&#8217;s firm is expected to be overtaken by domestic rival BYD as the world&#8217;s largest EV producer by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>In response, Tesla is planning a refresh of its most popular car, with Bloomberg reporting that the company aims to produce a new version of the Model Y in China next year. Musk has noted the rise in Chinese EV manufacturers as the US carmaker&#8217;s main competition, describing them as &#8220;extremely competitive&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coffee chain has been under pressure due to politics and unionization.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27323 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-1.jpg" alt="SBUX – Daily Chart" width="784" height="592" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-1.jpg 784w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x580.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">SBUX – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBUX</a> trades at $97.72, with support at $95.00 and $89.32 on further weakness.</p>
<p>Some consumers have been boycotting the company since October after it sued Workers United, which organizes its employees, due to the union posting a pro-Palestinian message on social media.</p>
<p>Starbucks wanted to halt the union using its name and logo, saying the company had no official stance on the war, but the company has taken criticism on the matter.</p>
<p>Some stores were vandalized, and Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan wrote an open letter against the protests in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I am grateful for so much, I am concerned about the state of the world we live in. There are conflicts in many parts. It has unleashed violence against the innocent, hate and weaponized speech and lies — all of which we condemn,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Our stance is clear. We stand for humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seattle-based Starbucks has yet to say how it has impacted sales. The company&#8217;s subsequent quarterly earnings will come out in February. But there are indications the company is seeing a hit to sales.</p>
<p>In early December, J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe lowered his US sales forecast for Starbucks&#8217; fiscal first quarter, saying holiday sales appeared to be slower than promotions in the fall. Starbucks&#8217; shares dropped on the news while videos on X showed protests and empty stores in London, Australia, Dubai, and others.</p>
<p>Starbucks has since offered more deals than usual to draw customers, like half-price Thursday drinks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reversal of fortune for Starbucks after it reported record sales in its latest quarter and said growth was accelerating in China.</p>
<p>The company has also faced strike issues due to the union, with workers at 370 company-owned stores voting to unionize since late 2021, but the company has not confirmed a contract with them. Workers walked out at several stores in December, and this month, the union is urging consumers not to buy the company&#8217;s gift cards.</p>
<p>SBUX shares could see further pressure into its February report and beyond if there are signs of slowing sales.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">NVDA &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>NVDA traded at $482.80 at midday US on Wednesday, the same level of $502 that capped prices in August.</p>
<p>Nvidia shares dropped around 3% on fears that larger US chip curbs would slow growth in China, its third-largest market, and halt the AI-driven business boom. At one point, the company was on course to erase more than $40 billion in market capitalization.</p>
<p>Nvidia, which has been the leader in artificial intelligence developments with its graphics processing units, said its China market will suffer from <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/market-news/nvidia-earnings-guide-tech-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tighter export controls</a>. However, the company still forecast revenue of $20 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts&#8217; estimates by more than $2 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>China contributed over a fifth of Nvidia&#8217;s total revenue in the latest quarter, which is a concern for the future. It was also said that companies like Baidu had loaded up on billions of dollars of chips ahead of the ban, which will likely lead to slower sales in coming quarters. Some analysts said Nvidia&#8217;s shares were priced for strong earnings and could be at risk.</p>
<p>However, at least seven brokerages raised their price targets for NVDA, with the median now at $625, more than $125 above its last closing price. The company said it will continue to see growth in the Data Center segment in 2025 and plans to increase chip supply quarterly.</p>
<p>Data centre revenues jumped to $14.5 billion, ahead of estimates of $12.97 billion, due to business from cloud infrastructure providers. That was up 279% from the same time last year and 41% from the previous quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">Apple stock</a><span>&nbsp;</span>has been seeking to recover from an early August slump, and the new iPhone release hype could help.</p>
<p><span id="more-24255"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/AAPL%E2%80%93Daily-Chart-New-Iphone.webp" width="763" height="597" loading="lazy" alt="AAPL–Daily-Chart-New-Iphone" style="height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 763px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto">AAPL – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of AAPL stock has rallied toward the 2021 high of $182.13, which will be an essential level in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>The new iPhone 15 is set to be released, and rumours are it will cost more than the 14. Apple might ask between $1,099 to $1,199 in the U.S. for the iPhone 15 Pro, compared to $999 for the iPhone 14 Pro. With the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, the asking price is set to be $1,199 or $1,299, as opposed to $1,099 for the current model.</p>
<p>The company will likely squeeze the last of the inflation pressures out of the economy to counter a sales slowdown this year.</p>
<p>The iPhone 15 is said to be launching in September and may have a much longer battery life. According to a new report published on 21 August, the handsets may be charged at up to 35W speeds, meaning charging could be up to 100 per cent faster. The iPhone 14 Pro is limited to 27W, while the standard iPhone 14 is capped at 20W.</p>
<p>With the Labor weekend on 4 September, speculation is for an announcement around 14 September and a release a week later.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has said that Apple is the &#8220;most under-owned&#8221; large cap-tech stock that it tracks. Analysts, led by Erik Woodring, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this is a reflection of the significant weighting Apple has in market indices, especially after outperforming the market year-to-date by 30 points at the peak in late July, as well as investor concerns about the divergence between valuation and near-term fundamentals (guidance for F4Q suggests revenue will decline year-over-year for the 4th consecutive quarter)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Additionally, they noted that while demand for the Mac and iPad are still &#8220;challenged,&#8221; the firm said growth in the September quarter is likely to be in the &#8220;right places,&#8221; with year-over-year growth in the iPhone and an acceleration in Services.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result, we see 5% upside to Street EPS estimates in fiscal 2024, and expect the stock to outperform as growth accelerates, margins expand year-over-year, and consensus estimates move higher,&#8221; the analysts added.</p>
