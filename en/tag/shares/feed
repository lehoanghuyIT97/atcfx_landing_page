										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">It can be said that for retailers of all shapes and sizes 2020 to date has been a challenging year. But what is evident, even at this stage in the pandemic, is that the headwinds of COVID-19 have affected companies unevenly, with those with greatest market share tending to suffer less. As far as the Walmart share price we saw much less of a downturn in the general stock market selloff during March. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Instead, WMT shares are one of a select group where the stock is now trading significantly higher than it was pre-pandemic. Indeed, it is worth looking at the factors surrounding the giant US retailer. Much of the positivity surrounding the Walmart share price in recent months appears to be less to do with the difficulties in the retail space, and more related to the company’s ability to outshine analysts expectations. The key as far as the ongoing rally is concerned is whether Walmart can continue to remain one step ahead of the market.</span></p>

<p><span id="more-10734"></span></p>
<h2>Walmart shares corporate strategy</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">In times of crisis it is very often the strategic capability of management to steer a company in the right direction, and with Walmart we have seen this illustrated in recent months. For instance, early in November the company announced a retreat from its Argentina operations. This was well received by the market, suggesting that Walmart was keen to focus on core markets offering the most reliable returns. In fact, it is this ruthless pruning of any weak performance that explains why Walmart shares continue to outperform.</span></p>

It’ll cover all major releases from global economies and give you the exact time the release is due, the previous data, forecast data and actual data (once released).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Consistency of earnings for WMT shares<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The consistency of earnings this brings was illustrated by the latest Q3 earnings forecast, which came in at $132.7bn, a year on year rise of 3.7%. This is not only outstanding in its own right for a $400bn market capitalisation company. It also underlines the way that for Walmart shares to date, the pandemic environment appears to have been a positive for earnings. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Such a counterintuitive conclusion clearly explains why the WMT share price has become something of a stock market darling, rather in the way the likes of Amazon (AMZN), despite Walmart not being known primarily as a retailer that provides delivery in the way its rival Amazon does.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Walmart share price and COVID-19 vaccines</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">But key to any analysis of Walmart is how one expects the company to do going into 2021. This is especially so if the effects of the pandemic start to wane and the retail sector returns to a semblance of normality. A clue in this respect came early in November with the double vaccine news from<a href="/en/analysis/market-news/pfizer-share-price-vaccine-boost" rel="noopener"> Pfizer (PFE)</a> and <a href="/en/analysis/market-news/gold-price-moderna-vaccine" rel="noopener">Moderna (MRNA)</a>. This caused the Walmart share price to gap higher, hitting new peaks for 2020 above $150. These gains have been maintained, something which suggests that investors are betting on further growth, and are content with the prospect of ongoing dividend hikes, and even the higher analyst share price targets for the group at $175.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Given the latest breakout for WMT shares to new all time highs, it would appear that only sustained price action back below the late October support at $137 would really delay ongoing technical bullishness surrounding the Walmart.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">Cineworld share price had a stellar return of 331.23% from its October low to November high. However, from today, the Cineworld share price appears to be turning lower, as traders book-profits and investors are reminded of the perils of investing in the cinema operator.</span></p>
<div class="hs-embed-wrapper hs-fullwidth-embed" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; min-width: 256px; margin: auto;" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true">
<div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper">
<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;"></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">Today, the Financial Times reported that the world&#8217;s second largest cinema operator might enter into a voluntary insolvency process called “company voluntary arrangement” or CVA. The purpose is to reduce costs further. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">In their latest interim report, Cineworld reported that they had secured $361 million to help them survive. They also reported adjusted profits after-tax loss of $436 million in the first half of 2020. Yet the report was published before they decided to close all their 663 outlets on October 4. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">The move to close all their cinemas comes as movie producers have decided to postpone the release of potential cash cow movies like the latest James Bond flick until April 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">With no new films to show, Cineworld opted to shut their doors temporarily. This was then followed by a second UK national lockdown. There are talks of allowing people to meet over Christmas followed by another month of lockdown. The furlough scheme is set to end in March 2021 and gives an indicator of how long the second lockdown might last. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">In the US, COVID-19 cases continue to soar, and when President-elect Joe Biden takes power, it is likely that some restrictions will be placed in the US as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">Even if Cineworld wanted to open their doors, it is looking like COVID-19, lack of good movies, and lockdowns will stop people from enjoying the cinemas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener">Learn more about shares trading with us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10709"></span></p>
<h2>Why did Cineworld share price soar?</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">The Cineworld share price rose sharply on November 9 as <a href="/en/analysis/market-news/pfizer-share-price-vaccine-boost" rel="noopener">Pfizer</a> reported their vaccine had a 90% success rate. One week later, <a href="/en/analysis/market-news/gold-price-moderna-vaccine" rel="noopener">Moderna</a> reported that their vaccine had a 95% success rate. The news of the vaccine is great and caused investors to buy with the anticipation of Cineworld being able to survive this COVID-19 winter. However, it is unlikely that Cineworld’s money will last according to some analysts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">A race against time, will the money last?<br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">In a Telegraph article published on November 10, analysts said that the cinema operator would need to raise £380 million to survive until spring. Also, Bank of America, who worked with Cineworld in their attempted acquisition of the rival Cineplex, said that the $400 million Cineworld held in June would not be enough for the firm to survive Christmas. The next few weeks will therefore be critical for Cineworld, and Cineworld share investors, as failure to reduce costs might force the firm to raise new capital. This could dilute the value of the current shareholders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial;">CINE share price technical outlook</span></h3>
<p>From a technical point of view, the CINE share price is trading within a bearish wedge. The pattern is suggesting that as long as the price trades below the September 1 high of 68.93, we might see a slide to 33 and the October 28 low of 22.72. If the 22.72 level fails to hold, then the lower downward sloping trend line at 14.87 comes into play.</p>
<p>My personal view is that I think Cineworld will survive in one shape or another. However, with money running out fast Cineworld share investors could wake up to a nasty surprise. A good entry point is therefore very important for traders looking to bet on the firm’s revival. I think traders that are not already long will consider buying with low risk around 22.72, and the hope for the new vaccines to be deployed quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">It can be said that there are few stocks and sectors outside the pharma area who can prove comprehensively that they were doing worse before the pandemic broke in March, than after. But in the case of the home improvement group Topps Tiles share price, we are looking at a company which literally delivered a profits warning at the end of February, just weeks before the COVID-19 lockdown began for the first time. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">In some ways the profits warning was inevitable given the way that at the time of the Q1 update Topps Tiles said that like for like sales were down over 5%. At the time this was said to be due to political uncertainty, in the wake of the General Election, and ongoing Brexit uncertainty. Topps Tiles shares fell sharply at the time.</span></p>
<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener">Learn more about shares trading with us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10699"></span></p>
<h2>TPT share price pre-tax profits forecast</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Rather tellingly, broker Liberum then cut its full year pre-tax profit forecast from £13.5m to £7m. Now as we approach the full year results due out on December 1, it will probably be regarded as a triumph if profits come in at anywhere near £7m. Nevertheless, the fundamental picture for the Topps Tiles share price has been far more complex, and perhaps rather better than might have been expected given the struggle reported just before the pandemic began.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">To see all upcoming news and data releases that’ll have an effect on the financial markets, check out our <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/economic-calendar"><span>Economic Calendar</span></a>. It’ll cover all major releases from global economies and give you the exact time the release is due, the previous data, forecast data and actual data (once released).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">A rare retail winner in Topps Tiles shares<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Something which few would have anticipated in the wake of the pandemic in March this year is that there would be some retail winners. It required even more imagination to anticipate that with consumers confined to their homes, they might consider home improvement. This would either be in order to make their immediate environment more comfortable, but also to repair the wear and tear from being at home almost all the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Topps Tiles share price H1 loss</h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">In fact, things got worse before they got better, with May’s first half loss revealing a £4m deficit. This compared to a previous £5.2m profit, underlining the way that the negative pre-pandemic momentum was still very much in force. That is not to say that there were not some plus points. For instance, the cash position for Topps Tiles shares was strong at £14m, and likely to be helped by passing on the dividend. Topps also had the option of selling assets to raise further cash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Liberum buy rating for Topps Tiles shares</h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Perhaps the real cue to a turnaround though, was the reopening of stores, a process complete by the early summer. This coincided with Liberum actually reinstating Topps Tiles with a buy rating, on the basis of the company’s management being proactive, and the £14m cash pile. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Perhaps the real key to fundamental improvement arrived soon after as Topps Tiles became very much a part of the furloughed workers summer staycation routine. This phenomena has never really gone away since. Indeed, it was outstanding that for the six weeks to the end of August like for like sales were up 15%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Support for TPT shares and the TPT share price</h2>
<p>What will be particularly interesting as we head towards the full year results in December is whether the support for Topps Tiles shares continues? This is because they have been caught up in the COVID-19 vaccine stock rotation, as investors switch from technology and growth sectors, to value and recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key in the wake of next month’s results is how much the summer recovery will counteract the initial 2020 setback? Judging by the company’s call of a fall in revenues from £219m to £192m it could very well be the case that the fall in profits to £7m is no worse than the ultimate result. Certainly, anything over £7m would be regarded very positively by investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">It is usually the case that even with the most bullish of stocks and where market sentiment is high, the announcement of results that are in line with expectations can have a negative impression on the share price. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">This has been the case with streaming giant iQIYI shares even though the company’s main headline numbers at the Q3 stage matched analysts expectations. Consequently, the iQIYI share price has declined from post 2019 highs near $28, back to the $22 zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Fortunately for the bulls the shares have retreated towards the area of the 200 day moving average at $21.50 and an uptrend line from May at $22. The prospects for the iQIYI share price is now that after the initial negative price action in the wake of the Q3 results, the overall positive performance of the company on a fundamental basis is likely to kick in.</span></p>

<h2>IQ shares pandemic rotation</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">One of the characteristics of the stock market since the pandemic began in March this year, has been the rotation by investors from value stocks to high growth and momentum plays. The major beneficiaries have of course been stocks in the tech space, with iQIYI one of the leaders in this respect. However, judging by the latest results, even here there is the shadow of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Streaming space growth for IQ shares<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">For instance, online advertising revenue fell by 11% and content distribution revenue down 42%. Nevertheless, the setbacks were largely in the more minor income streams, and clearly within the streaming space which is growing rapidly. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Therefore investors did not have much more to grapple with than the headline number of subscriber numbers down from 105.8 million to 104.8 million. This was the trigger for the post announcement IQ share price decline, although the question is whether it was justified or not?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>IQIYI share price premium rating</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">As far as the near term it could be that iQIYI shares have to run in order to stand still fundamentally. This point was underlined by comments from the company suggesting that revenues would be flat as compared to last year, standing around $1.1bn. This, along with a lack of visibility in terms of what the fresh growth drivers may be could make it difficult for bulls of the stock to gain traction. Given the premium rating the shares have, it may have to wait until a market beating Q4 update is unveiled that a push for the stock to fresh 2 years highs may be possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to trade iQIYI shares</h2>

<p>1. Register for an account or log in to your existing account</p>
<p>2. Open MT4 either on your desktop or mobile</p>
<p>3. Search for iQIYI shares in the market watch or symbols window</p>
<p>4. Choose your position size</p>
<p>5. Hit buy or sell, and then confirm the trade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mist Theater popularity</h3>
<p>Perhaps the key to what happens next as far as the iQIYI share price is the overall state of the Chinese streaming market. Analysts have suggested that the space has not grown as much as expected over the past couple of years, but is expected to re-rate positively from now. If this proves to be the case, initiatives that iQIYI have made this year such as its hit Mist Theater, could prove to be growth leaders. Indeed, so far this content library of short suspense thrillers comprising five dramas has already generated 68 million subscribers, and proved to be the TikTok of its space in terms of popularity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">One of the best stock market rules regarding the share price of companies in the wake of results is that it is “better to travel than arrive.” This rule especially refers to the JD share price, where we have already been treated to months of outperformance. The best illustration of this is to look at the daily chart of the JD share price since the start of the year. Here it is evident that even accounting for a mild dip for JD shares in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis in March, the rebound for JD.com shares from a $32 low has been spectacular.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10658"></span></p>
<h2>JD shares in the China e-commerce space</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">In the near term it is obvious that the driver for the stock has been JD.com’s position as an e-commerce group, a space which was booming pre-pandemic. But now is pivotal to the economy both in its native China, and the rest of the world. It can also be said that JD.com shares occupy a significant position within the China e-commerce sector, second only to market leader Alibaba, but tellingly, with a more upmarket offering to consumers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">JD shares Q3 update<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">On the face of it, even after the stellar ride for the JD.com share price so far this year we should have been treated to a more robust performance in the aftermath of the latest Q3 results. This is because all the major metrics were of the knock the ball out of the park variety. For instance, revenues were up nearly 30%, and annual active customer accounts up 32%. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">This is remarkable growth given the way that the greater the growth in e-commerce, the greater the competition and fragmentation of the market. Indeed, if there was a concern regarding the latest Q3 update for JD.com shares, it was that in order to maintain growth, margins may have to be squeezed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>JD.com share price beats analysts expectations</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">One feature of the stock market is that it can reward companies that excel even when their stock has already risen, if analysts expectations are beaten. In the case of JD.com shares, they were. The company managed to serve up earnings of 50 cents a share versus market estimates of 41 cents a share. This is a pretty big win, and therefore holders of JD.com shares may regard themselves as somewhat unfortunate that there was a retracement for the stock in the wake of the Q3 update. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">While the pullback in JD.com shares may have been disappointing, as traders fretted about margins, something which even countered a very strong Singles Day performance on November 11. This in itself underlines how much the Chinese economy has bounced back since the pandemic began at the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to trade JD shares</h2>
<p>Open a <a href="https://apply-uk.atfx.com/register?lang=en" rel="noopener">live</a> or <a href="/en/trading-accounts/demo-account" rel="noopener">demo</a> account with ATFX to get started today.

<p>4. Choose your position size</p>
<p>5. Hit buy or sell, and then confirm the trade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>JD share price daily chart</h2>
<p>In terms of where JD.com shares are now on the daily chart, it can be seen that post April support for the stock has come in towards the 50 day moving average. This currently lies near the $80 level, something which suggests the latest pullback for the JD share price should be limited to that zone before the ongoing rally resumes.</p>

		<title>Disney share price: a COVID-19 loser, now a COVID-19 vaccine winner?</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Perhaps one of the surprise, and non-intuitive aspects of the stock market after a bear phase is that it can be the companies who were most hit by the downturn whose share price recovers best. This may be what we are witnessing at multimedia and entertainment giant Disney, as well as affecting the Disney share price.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The company’s flagship theme parks were in the firing line of COVID-19 lockdowns. Therefore, it was not surprising that from a December 2019 peak of $153 we saw the Walt Disney share price almost exactly halve by March, as investors fretted over the prospects for the pandemic Achilles Heel of Disney’s fundamentals, its theme parks.</span></p>
<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener">Learn more about shares trading with us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10622"></span></p>
<h2>Disney shares: Q4 update</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The latest update from Disney had most eyes looking at the performance of its parks business, the area directly in the firing line as far as the pandemic is concerned. Fortunately, for Disney shares we have not seen a total closure across the board, as could have been the case. Instead, the sporadic closures and now limited opening have had a partial impact on the performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Year on year revenue for Disney’s parks was down 61%. However, it could be that the greatest barrier to recovery, despite the cost savings, was laying off 28,000 workers. This will undoubtedly slow any fundamental rebound, even if the recent double vaccine boost from both <a href="/en/analysis/market-news/pfizer-share-price-vaccine-boost" rel="noopener">Pfizer</a> and <a href="/en/analysis/market-news/gold-price-moderna-vaccine" rel="noopener">Moderna</a> mean that a return to normality in the hospitality and travel sectors arrives sooner than is currently expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">To see all upcoming news and data releases that’ll have an effect on the financial markets, check out our <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/economic-calendar"><span>Economic Calendar</span></a>. It’ll cover all major releases from global economies and give you the exact time the release is due, the previous data, forecast data and actual data (once released).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">The first loss in 40 years for Disney shares<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Given the way that hospitality and leisure have been the greatest losers in the economy, it was always going to be the case that Disney shares would be seriously affected by the pandemic. The first annual loss in decades was perhaps not a surprise even though it served up shock value. The most interesting aspect though, is how much the parts of Disney not affected by social distancing have continued to contribute. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Going forward, it will be these parts of Disney which will determine whether the recovery we have seen in DIS shares from below $80 to nearly $140 is justified? Indeed, $6.9bn of the $7.4bn loss for the fiscal year came from theme parks and associated businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vaccine gains for the DIS share price</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The double vaccine news seen in the recent past from Pfizer and Moderna contributed to some 20% on the Walt Disney share price. Although the initial squeeze in the wake of Pfizer’s news ahead of the Q4 update three days later was the most spectacular. The explanation for this is it gave investors their first credible glimpse of a post pandemic world and a return to normality. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">However, as is normally the case with the stock market, it is notorious for jumping the gun in terms of either downturns or upturns. Therefore, in the case of Disney shares, while theme parks may have dominated the downturn, it could be that the leader ahead of COVID-19 vaccines doing their job will be the direct to customer business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Disney+ to drive Disney shares</h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">The good news is that Disney+, its media streaming service to rival Netflix and Amazon Prime was already on the runway as COVID-19 hit. From a standing start it is now up to 73 million subscribers, as compared to Netflix at 195 million subscribers. It may very well be the case that should Disney+ continue to grow, the Disney share price will be supported more by this than the re-opening of theme parks in 2021.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">On November 9 the Pfizer share price not only received a shot in the arm from the company’s own groundbreaking COVID-19 vaccine news. It also boosted world stock markets as well as the Pfizer share price. Part of the enthusiasm for the 90% effective / store at -70 centigrade vaccine was clearly the relief of the announcement marking the beginning of the end of the pandemic, both in terms of victims and economies.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The news could be even more of a breakthrough if as Pfizer has promised it can turn the vaccine into a powder, sidestepping the ultra cold storage issue. However, digging deeper into the news it could be argued that it raises as many questions as it answers for the Pfizer share price. Who will win the COVID-19 vaccine race, as well as what the financial benefits may be to Pfizer shares?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10607"></span></p>
<h2>CEO Albert Bourla sells Pfizer shares</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">One of the events that added spice to the Pfizer’s vaccine news was the simultaneous sale on the day of $5.6m worth of Pfizer shares by the CEO of the company. Given the way that share dealings by company executives are one of the most important signals to investors, the timing here for the PFE share price was unfortunate to say the least. In fact, Pfizer said that the deal had been set up as long ago as August, via an automated price limit. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">However, the fact that the stock only rose 15% at the peak on the day can be explained by the way that the Pfizer shares sale by the CEO damaged sentiment, albeit inadvertently. Nevertheless, rather than sentiment surrounding the news, it was the prospects for the company after the development of the vaccine which were key for investors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">How much could Pfizer shares gain from a COVID-19 vaccine?<br /></span></h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">There are two key factors for Pfizer with regard to a COVID-19 vaccine. The first is how effective the vaccine is itself. But perhaps more importantly in the wake of Moderna’s 94.5% effective vaccine, whether the COVID-19 vaccine battle will become a race with two or even more horses? If this is the case the estimates in terms of earnings could become far more complex than they may appear currently. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Current estimates are that Pfizer and partner BioNTech could make up to 1.3bn vaccine doses by the end of 2021. This may make up for the fact that aside from a COVID-19 vaccine the Pfizer share price has been pressured by year on year sales actually declining over the past six quarters. The prospect of this slide being halted could boost Pfizer shares, if the competition from subsequent vaccines such as the latest from <a href="/en/analysis/market-news/gold-price-moderna-vaccine" rel="noopener">Moderna</a> do not undermine its offering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pfizer shares need a COVID-19 vaccine boost</h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">While the arrival of its COVID-19 vaccine is welcome, it is clear that it is timely as well. Across Pfizer’s portfolio in recent years we have seen blockbuster drugs fail relative to rivals. This was particularly underlined in the summer of 2020 with the relative disappointment associated with its breast cancer test Ibrance relative to that of rival Eli Lilly.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">One of the traditional strengths of companies in the utility sector is that they are dull and dependable. Unfortunately, the aftermath of the COVID-19 has left few sectors and even fewer companies unaffected, whether positively or negatively. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Earlier this year there were signs that things were going to get stirred up for the National Grid share price. This was going to be both a fundamental and technical basis, and underlined by the way that the stock fell from a 1,073p peak in February to a 789p floor in March in the wake of the first lockdown. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The 25% decline was only slightly less than the one third plus declines for stocks in most sectors, and clearly disappointing for those on board National Grid shares for perceived defensive qualities. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">While the stock has retraced to the middle of the range near 950p since the spring, the newsflow since then has underlined the way that the sell off earlier this year was justifiable, if only on the basis of the various headwinds affecting the National Grid share price.</span></p>
<p><a href="/en/markets/shares-trading" rel="noopener">Learn more about shares trading with us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-10583"></span></p>
<h2>National Grid shares debt level</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Perhaps the first point to note is that with net debt at £30.1bn and set to rise to £31.6bn by the second half of the year, we are looking at a company which is swimming through treacle in terms of its cash position.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">This point was emphasised in the wake of the latest first half underlying operating profit which fell 12% to £1.1bn.The excuse for this was said to be the impact of COVID-19 related costs, expected to hit £400m for the full year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">The fundamental elephant in the room<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">However, tough as the present environment has been, it may be that there is a fundamental elephant in the room. This aspect makes such near term earnings and debt issues as relatively insignificant. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The risk for the National Grid share price is that in order for the UK Government to achieve its net carbon neutral goals it would break up the utility. The problem is the conflict of interest for National Grid in being the Electricity System Operator, as well as owning the network. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The question is whether in order to get to the carbon neutral destination, a more drastic action than having legally separated the ESO three years ago is seen as enough?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>National Grid shares £400m profits miss</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Perhaps more important to focus on though is the £400m miss on profits this year, and rather than a breakup, a lower allowed profits return for National Grid shares would be far more damaging. Trumping all of these factors though, may be how National Grid decides to treat shareholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">In a year when one of the worst aspects has not just been National Grid share price falls, but dividend payouts being cut, investors are most likely to focus on how much National Grid shares yield. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Having raised the payout on a full year basis, and being likely to repeat the gesture at the interim stage as well, it may be that holders of NG shares remain loyal until the big picture issues surrounding the company are finally resolved.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The INTU share price is special amongst leading stocks in the sense that it has not only fully recovered from the February &#8211; March 2020 decline, but is now trading well above initial 2020 highs. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">This is all the more impressive given the way that the company is not one of the high profile FAANGS, but nevertheless has developed the kind of momentum of the best of them, like Facebook and Amazon. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">In fact, with its accounting and tax software, we have a company which is clearly an evergreen in terms of the economic cycle.</span></p>

<p><span id="more-10574"></span></p>
<h2>INTU shares pandemic winner</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Even a pandemic cannot really get in the way of paying tax for consumers. Therefore, we have in this company which combines two of the greatest buzzword concepts of the Cloud, and software as a service (SaaS). </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The characteristics of a company’s revenue stream from SaaS is very much in the steady category, rather than blow the lights out. This may sound dull, but during the COVID-19 era investors will be grateful for consistency, rather than volatility in earnings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Intuit share price Q4 update<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The point was underlined at the time of Intuit shares Q4 update at the end of August. This was clearly the key post pandemic update, and it did not disappoint. Indeed, quite the opposite. Intuit has made a habit of beating consensus expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">However, the extension of the US tax year, and the need by many to file their taxes at home online, rather than through a third party in person, meant that Intuit said it had its best quarter in 15 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The Q4 2020 revenue rise of 83% was something that few could anticipate. The issue now is perhaps how much Intuit can build on these unique early 2020 gains, something we shall find out via the Q1 2021 update from Intuit on November 19.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INTU shares outperform</h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The irony as far as the INTU share price performance is that while it has been strong, it may be argued that it still pales into insignificance as compared to the rising fundamental metrics over the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The point is highlighted by the way that the company has swung from a 9 cents a share loss versus $1.18 in the past quarter. True, the onset of the pandemic managed to catch out analysts causing Intuit to massively outperform. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">What will be interesting to see at the next update where the earnings consensus of just 5 cents a share appears to be something it will be very difficult for Intuit not to beat. This is even though the skew in earnings at the company is towards Q3. Last year’s 4.1 cents a share at Q1 compares to the estimates for this year’s first quarter at 4 cents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>INTU share price 2020 momentum</h2>
<p>Given the momentum in the latter half of 2020, and the way it is unlikely that this momentum will be extinguished until the pandemic is over, it is probable that as in the case of most recent quarters analysts will be under-estimating the Intuit share price performance.</p>
<p>One would then expect this positive surprise to lead to further share price strength, especially as the stock has tended to be more sensitive to the fundamentals than analysts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Many sectors have been affected by the aftermath of COVID-19 striking earlier this year. For the Persimmon share price it is clear that the housing market remains in a robust state. This concept remains underlined at housebuilder Persimmon, in the wake of the latest Q3 update. The headline here was that average weekly sales were up 38% versus 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">This is a spectacular result given the way that the lockdowns so far this year will have undoubtedly slowed down activity. But even so this year has proved to be a big winner for PSN shares, as compared to even before the pandemic began.</span></p>

<p><span id="more-10562"></span></p>
<h2>Robust performance for Persimmon shares</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">The key to the ongoing robust performance is clearly persistent demand, a point witnessed by the way the company said that it has nearly £1.4bn in forward sales for next year. This is up a stunning 43% on the same time last year. With such a pipeline and visibility on earnings, Persimmon shares are rare in terms of leading blue chip stocks to be in such a secure position financially.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">PSN share price paying dividends<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Given the healthy earnings it is not surprising that Persimmon can afford to reward its shareholders. This is particularly so given that the dividend had to be postponed in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. Therefore, the latest payouts totally 110p are what would have been received last year. To add some cheer for the end of this year Persimmon has promised to pay another dividend by Christmas. All of this sounds relatively straightforward given the way that the company was sitting on nearly £1bn in cash by the end of last month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking to trade <span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">Persimmon</span> shares and other major company shares? Open a <a href="https://apply-uk.atfx.com/register?lang=en" rel="noopener">live</a> or <a href="/en/trading-accounts/demo-account" rel="noopener">demo</a> account with ATFX to get up to speed.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Persimmon share price: Shooting for pre-pandemic highs</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial">However, despite the shares trading near post pandemic highs of 2,855p, they are still well off the initial peak of the year achieved in February at 3,328p. While this may be regarded as an opportunity, given the fundamental achievements of the group since the March lockdown began, it is nevertheless something of a mystery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Persimmon shares pipeline</h3>
<p>On the basis of the pipeline, and the cash in the bank one would suggest that the share price of Persimmon should be much higher. This is at least said on the basis of the sales and booked orders. Indeed, the only real fundamental clouds on the horizon may be that of land supply. <br />This metric was one not really noticed by commentators in the wake of the Q3 update. So far this year Persimmon has secured 1,700 plots. Last year it had 7,300. The implication is that with much less land going forward the company’s capacity to build may be constrained. Part of the cure initially will no doubt be to raise prices, but this can only be seen as a temporary measure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;text-transform: initial;background-color: transparent">Persimmon share price: daily chart</span></h2>
<p>Looking at the daily chart of Persimmon over the past year it can be said that the journey for the PSN share price has been typical of the trajectory for many blue chips. This has taken the form of a decline from February and then a partial recovery since March. The key area of resistance is August’s 2,855p, a zone which could be attacked towards the end of 2020 in anticipation of a promised dividend payout.</p>
