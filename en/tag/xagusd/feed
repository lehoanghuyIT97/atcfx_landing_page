<p style="text-align: center;">XAGUSD &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>XAGUSD recently took a sharp 3-day drop to trade near the $28.000 level. That brought a strong rebound with prices back to $32.60 and looking at the previous highs around $35.00.</p>
<p>Continued weakness in the U.S. dollar and turmoil around markets are driving flows to safe havens. A stronger economy in China can push more silver investment and support manufacturing needs. Gold and silver remain popular as economies struggle for growth and markets reel over tariffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;While base metals price forecasts have been marked lower due to these tariff concerns, there is an expectation of a favourable risk/reward scenario for investing in base metals in the coming quarters,&#8221; JP Morgan analysts said.</p>
<p>Silver tracks the price of gold, but industrial uses such as electronics and solar account for more than half of global demand, estimated at 700 million troy ounces in 2024, according to the Silver Institute industry association.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would expect silver to lag gold until there is more economic clarity and a resolution in trade and tariff risks, given silver&#8217;s exposure to industrial activity and PMIs,&#8221; said Aakash Doshi, head of global gold at State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<p>Recent market turmoil and record highs in gold also bring attention to retail investors, which could increase silver interest as it is a more cost-effective entry to <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precious metals</a>.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded fund buying and central bank buying of precious metals also drive up precious metals.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47442 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart.png" alt="xagusd,silver,spot" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart.png 840w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">XAGUSD &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p>The price of XAGUSD is approaching recent resistance at $34.20 and a breakout higher could another leg to the rally.</p>
<p>In recent months, there has been a drive to bring physical silver onshore to the United States, leading to a sharp rise in COMEX inventories, which are 60% higher since December.</p>
<p>While the official explanation points to potential tariffs from the Trump administration on imported silver, there may be other reasons for the scramble. Further confirming the scramble for physical silver has been a surge in trading volume since December in the Sprott Physical Silver Trust, the most well-known physically backed silver exchange-traded product. The non-physically backed iShares Silver Trust has been flat over the same period, highlighting a clear investor preference for products backed by real silver.</p>
<p>Another reason for the recent surge is that <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold has hit new highs</a> this year. Over the past year, gold has outperformed, while silver has lagged, but the dynamic may be about to shift. Silver remains deeply undervalued relative to gold, and a correction in that dynamic may be imminent.</p>
<p>With gold now holding the level above the key $3,000 psychological level, the bias remains to the upside. This continued bullish momentum in gold should create a strong tailwind for silver moving forward.</p>
<p>Silver’s outlook is increasingly tied to the inflation narrative playing out in the global economy. President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, set to take effect April 2, are widely expected to boost import prices. Economists estimate the inflation impact could exceed a full percentage point, while Fed officials anticipate a temporary spike, others warn of longer-lasting pressure, adding uncertainty to interest rate decisions​​.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">XAGUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>XAGUSD has found support at the $29.66 level which could see a rally over the next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/most-traded-commodities-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silver and gold</a> have been sold off after reports of a ceasefire in Lebanon and the choice of investment professional Scott Bessent as U.S. Treasury Secretary. Silver suffered worse but a rebound to around $33/oz is possible according to investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Strong industrial demand from the electronics sector is another factor that could see silver outperform gold next year. Only 10% of gold is consumed by industry, while an estimated 55% of silver goes into products such as solar and photovoltaics (PVs) where demand grew by 33% last year and 64% this year. Silver has also been used in electric vehicles and semiconductors which are touted as growth sectors.</p>
<p>Another appeal for silver is a growing market deficit which opened five years ago and has since widened with the shortfall in fresh mine supply being met by a drawdown in above ground stocks.</p>
<p>Silver may be making a low here and that could be related to the tensions between Russia and western nations and could lead to a surge in the price of precious metals if there is escalation.</p>
