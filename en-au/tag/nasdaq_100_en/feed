										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US tech stocks rallied by 2% on Tuesday after hopes increased over trade deal talk.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48323" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48323" style="width: 814px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48323" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NAS-100-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="NAS 100 – Weekly Chart" width="814" height="565" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NAS-100-–-Weekly-Chart.png 814w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NAS-100-–-Weekly-Chart-300x208.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NAS-100-–-Weekly-Chart-768x533.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48323" class="wp-caption-text">NAS 100 – Weekly Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAS 100</a> found support at the 17,000 level and is now looking to secure the next leg higher. A move to 20,000 is possible this week if buyers continue to return.</p>
<p>The stock market rallied as the White House said it was hopeful for trade deals with over 100 countries that could settle recent tariff wars. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also hinted at a possible easing in tensions with China.</p>
<p>“No one thinks the current status quo is sustainable,” he said. President Trump added tariffs of 145% on China, which hit back with a 125% tariff on US products.</p>
<p>No trade deals have been announced since the April 2 blanket tariffs, but the White House Press Secretary said there was progress.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of progress being made. We now have 18 proposals on paper that have been brought to the trade team”.</p>
<p>Leavitt said the &#8216;entire trade team&#8217; was meeting with 34 countries this week after the 90-day pause. The US markets were heading for their worst April since 1932 before the latest rally. Some of those losses came after Trump’s criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and threats to remove him.</p>
<p>Markets were afraid of a panic move lower if he interfered with the central bank’s independence. The recent stock rally will lighten the mood but there is still negative headline risk.</p>
<p>Trump said he has “no intention” of firing Powell in another climbdown related to market losses. &#8220;I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates,&#8221; Trump said, despite his recent personal attack against the Fed Chair on social media.</p>
<p>Trump may not be helping his own situation as Powell may want to cut rates at the next central and appear to be taking his cues from the President.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US tech stocks have continued a brutal descent with a move below the 20,000 level.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46775" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NAS 100 – Daily Chart" width="888" height="518" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart.png 888w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-300x175.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NAS 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has breached the opening levels of the post-Trump election win rally. The next target on the downside is 18,330, with the 20,000 level now being key to the upside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nasdaq 100 collection of the top </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US tech stocks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is down around 15% since February. However, the price has stalled since the arrival of China’s DeepSeek AI tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rally in AI stocks was already losing ground ahead of the rival model as catalysts had dried up. The so-called Gig Tech firms had been spending hugely on data centers in the US and this spending may start to unwind after DeepSeek showed that models can be built without big capital expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most popular stocks in a rally can be the worst performers in a downtrend and that has been the case with Tesla down -50%, Palantir down -40% and, Nvidia down -30% from their respective all-time highs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The path ahead now looks troubled after the Trump administration’s tariffs. Tesla has been under fire because its founder aligned himself with the White House. Protests against the company and even vandalism against vehicles have added to a sharp sales downturn in Europe and China. With Chinese EV makers gaining ground, Tesla is finally shaking off its huge overvaluation against the sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The President has tried to support the carmaker by saying he will buy a Tesla and drove one of the company’s vehicles onto the White House lawn on Tuesday. His support may be negative according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tesla is becoming a political symbol of Trump and DOGE, and that is a bad thing for the brand,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ives also believes that Palantir’s losses will be temporary as companies increase AI spending in the coming years. In the meantime, the bears are in control of the Nasdaq 100.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq 100 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States has stocks trading near the 2024 highs, but higher interest rates bring caution.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44254" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NAS 100 – Daily Chart" width="823" height="514" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart.png 823w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-300x187.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nas 100 was trading at 21,818 on Thursday after a small dip on bond prices. The all-time highs are in close sight, with support already tested once at 20,781.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech stocks saw a small loss on Thursday as US bond yields reached a six-month high. Part of the market rally has been driven by the expectation of swift Federal Reserve rate cuts but that was dampened at the previous week’s FOMC rate decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed has telegraphed only two rate cuts in 2025, but traders may be less sure about the outcome for the economy. The expectation for deregulation from Donald Trump’s new administration may also be why traders are ignoring the Fed’s update. The markets are pricing the chances at 9% for a -25 bp rate cut at the January 28-29 FOMC meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was boosted by Asia as Chinese stocks closed slightly higher due to speculation that China may sell a record 3 trillion yuan ($411 billion) of special Treasury bonds in 2025 to support the economy. Trump’s tariff threat may ensure that the PBoC does take some form of action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year ahead will be reliant on the AI rally and it remains to be seen if big tech firms can continue to pump billions into graphics chips from the likes of Nvidia.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NAS 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has dipped below recent resistance at the 19,955 level. Further weakness could open up a larger correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech stocks in the US were mildly lower, pressured by higher bond yields, with 10-year yields climbing to a 2-month high after Friday’s stronger-than-expected Sept payroll report. The labour market strength eliminated the market odds for a -50 bp rate cut by the Fed at next month’s FOMC meeting.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The markets will now await consumer price data on Thursday to see if the trend in slowing prices will continue. The consensus is for September’s CPI to ease to +2.3% on an annual basis from +2.5% in August. September’s CPI (ex-food and energy) is expected to remain unchanged from August at +3.2%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders have now discounted the chances at 83% for a -25 bp rate cut at the November 6-7 FOMC meeting and at 0% for a -50 bp rate cut at that meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle East tensions have also reduced the appetite for risk assets and are a negative weight on stocks. In addition to Gaza, Israel is waging a ground and air offensive in Lebanon against the Hezbollah group. The Israel Defense Force (IDF) said today that it had deployed a third division of troops in southern Lebanon while maintaining airstrikes in Beirut.  The markets are also awaiting Israel’s response to last Tuesday’s missile attack from Iran. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was -2% lower after Wells Fargo reduced its weighting of the company’s stock to equal weight from overweight. </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/market-news/telsa-shares-drop-weaker-delivery-numbers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla stock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has its important robotaxi event this week but the stock lost ground on Monday, down -3.13%.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As traders consider the rate cut path, US tech stocks have stumbled ahead of the psychological 20,000 level. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NAS 100 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has faltered ahead of the 20,000 level. There is support at the current price, with a move below possibly opening another correction to 18,250. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street stocks finished lower on Thursday with a big dent in chipmakers as central bankers met at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Investors will be hanging on the Friday speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell to gauge the trajectory for US interest rate cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market heavyweight Nvidia sank 3.7% ahead of the AI chipmaker&#8217;s quarterly report next week, which could have a significant bearing on the path of tech stocks.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money markets are pricing in a 75% chance of a 25 basis point cut and a 25% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the Fed&#8217;s September policy meeting, according to a CME Fedwatch tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentiment was hurt after Boston Fed President Collins said she expects the central bank to begin easing rates soon. However, &#8220;a gradual, methodical pace&#8221; of cuts is likely appropriate.  Philadelphia Fed President Harker echoed that statement, saying &#8220;a slow, methodical approach to lowering rates is the right way to go&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets have also been absorbing negative news on the US jobs market after an early revision downgraded a recent payrolls improvement by -818k jobs, the most significant downgrade since 2009 at the tail end of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial crisis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current price level will be necessary ahead of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next week, led by chipmaker Nvidia.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street stocks had their best day since the start of 2023, helping to ease recent fears about the tech rally. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NAS 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tech stock index bounced from a low level of around 18,000, with the price clearing previous support. The index will look to secure the recent lows as a base for a rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jumped 2.2% in late trading, heading for its best day since the first week of 2023. The Nasdaq 100 was 2.7% higher, with Big Tech stocks leading. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets were boosted by the latest jobless claims data, which showed that fewer US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The data was better than economists had expected. The same data on unemployment claims last week began a sharp drop in stocks, totalling 9% in the S&amp;P 500. Investors were shocked by the speed of the drop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, BNP Paribas analysts said the market&#8217;s drop looks more like a &#8220;positioning-driven crash&#8221; caused by too many investors making the same trades and taking profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jobless claims data may help fears over last week&#8217;s weaker NFP jobs report. Investors will turn their attention to next week&#8217;s inflation data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPI data on Tuesday are expected to drop by 0.1%, and the annual inflation rate a day later is expected to drop similarly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week&#8217;s move in the VIX Index of stock-market volatility reached a level not seen since the Covid outbreak more than four years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the summer low liquidity, the still heavy trend plays that need unwinding and the VIX sky-high, this sell-off move could go on for a few days,&#8221; Florian Ielpo of Lombard Odier Asset Management said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, &#8220;the macro picture itself is not as bad as the market seems to think&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the rally in chip stocks has found a floor, with Arm Holdings up 10% on the day and Nvidia up more than 6%. The strong rebound could boost Asian markets on Friday.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq 100 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the top tech stocks suffered a strongly bearish week and could fall further. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37969" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NASDAQ-100-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="NASDAQ 100 – Weekly Chart" width="673" height="592" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NASDAQ-100-–-Weekly-Chart.png 673w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NASDAQ-100-–-Weekly-Chart-300x264.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASDAQ 100 – Weekly Chart</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NAS 100 saw its sharpest weekly drop since April and has correction potential to 18,420. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology stocks in the United States have driven the entire stock market due to excitement over artificial technology. Chip stocks like Nvidia were the first beneficiaries of the AI hype and are now testing the bull market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dutch chipmaker ASML fell more than 16% in the week after the Biden administration said it would impose the highest sanctions on companies selling high-end chips to China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drop in the Nasdaq has also affected the price of Microsoft and Apple, with the two seeing all-time highs this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bargain-hunting investors will see this sell-off as an opportunity to buy the dip. However, caution would be advised after valuations soared to records on hype over a technology that has not delivered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks were lower, with Amazon down around -6 % and Meta Platforms down -4.2% for the week. If institutional investors want to take profits, investors will be on guard for further capitulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another hit to tech stocks came last week after an IT outage led to delays in air travel and other businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Microsoft blamed a &#8220;third party&#8221; for the problems impacting its systems worldwide. The tech giant said: &#8220;We&#8217;re aware of an issue affecting Windows devices due to an update from a third-party software platform. We anticipate a resolution is forthcoming.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity stocks were higher after the event but could not outweigh the bearishness on the day.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&#8217;s big event is the latest US inflation report, with markets poised for volatility. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37375" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NAS 100 – Daily Chart" width="897" height="639" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart.png 897w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-300x214.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-768x547.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 897px) 100vw, 897px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq 100 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been grinding higher, and the uptrend is starting to look steep. If selling arrives, investors should be wary of an extended pullback.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg reported that JP Morgan analysts have warned of volatility around this week&#8217;s CPI inflation figures. Based on the price of straddles expiring that day, the options market is pricing in a move of around 0.9% in either direction by Thursday. A higher inflation print could end any hopes of two rate cuts by the Fed this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday&#8217;s report will be released at 8:30 pm HKT but will spill over into Friday and probably next week. Markets expect the inflation rate to drop to 3.1% from 3.3% in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, traders were on the fence after Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at elevated rates but also said the jobs market was cooling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re not just an inflation-targeting central bank,&#8221; Powell told Congress. &#8220;We also have an employment mandate.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Powell said this week that the Fed had made &#8220;considerable progress&#8221; toward lowering inflation but warned that cutting rates &#8220;too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most economists expect the US central bank&#8217;s first rate cut to occur in September. Powell refused to confirm when he saw the first cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various markets have been confused about whether the Fed will cut twice this year. Thursday&#8217;s data will heavily influence that decision, ripple through stocks,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bonds, and</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States surged to test all-time highs after a slight dip in inflation. </span></p>
<p><b> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33582" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="NAS 100 – Daily Chart" width="868" height="595" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 868w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x206.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NAS-100-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x526.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NAS 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was pushing through the all-time highs at 18,492 and will try to make a daily close above that for a potential breakout higher. Traders should be on alert for a false breakout or a double top. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US CPI report for April came in at expectations, with the annual rate for headline price growth falling to 3.4% from 3.5%, while the core rate declined to 3.6%. The core inflation rate has been at its lowest level for three years, and headline prices have stabilised from previous volatility. Monthly rates of price growth were also more moderate, with core and headline monthly inflation rates rising by 0.3%, the slowest growth rate since January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest data gives some hope that price growth is coming down in the US. The number was in line with expectations. However, traders were focused on weaker retail sales, which may force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates earlier than expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced retail sales increased by 0% last month, while core retail sales, which exclude fuel, fell by 0.1%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech stocks found a broad-based rally, but the usual suspects led the charge, with Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, and Apple gaining the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although stocks were surging on the latest inflation print, many analysts said before the release that they did not see any early action from the Federal Reserve.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While this morning&#8217;s CPI report could spark some big near-term moves, we don&#8217;t anticipate turning bearish until it&#8217;s clear that either (1) the US is heading for recession, or (2) the Fed will hike to tame inflation,&#8221; Wolfe economists said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed Chair Jerome Powell reminded markets this week that even if inflation continued to decrease, it would likely be at a slower pace than desired.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NAS 100 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nasdaq 100 is finding support at the 18,000 level and could soon move to the all-time highs. A late-March selloff reversed below the 17,000 level and looked like a near-term correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks dipped on Wednesday, but there is still a sign of buyers in play. The Nasdaq 100 has been boosted by strong earnings from Google, Microsoft, and </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/market-news/apple-investors-brace-q2-earnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which gives investors confidence to continue buying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs also noted that its share buyback desk is busy again, with $5.5 billion in repurchases every day this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are now comfortably within the open window which is estimated to run through 6/14/24,&#8221; the bank said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyft </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rose after the ride-hailing firm delivered higher results and guidance than estimates. Reddit stock also rose 13% after the social media company reported first-quarter results ahead of expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market will keep a keen eye on the situation in the Middle East, but without any shocking news, the Nasdaq could return to its all-time highs in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence will remain a key focus, and the economic impact could be even more significant than expected. Analysts at McKinsey &amp; Co. see a vast $4.4 trillion potentially added each year. Tech giants are increasing their efforts in space. The Economist says that the world&#8217;s largest cloud computing companies have invested </span><b>$40 billion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mainly in data centres with AI capability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will need to show up soon for tech stocks to hold onto their current valuations. Microsoft is valued at 35x annual earnings with a market cap of $3 trillion.</span></p>
