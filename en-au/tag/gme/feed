										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GameStop&#8217;s meme </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surged again on Monday after a Reddit post from the meme-craze architect &#8220;Roaring Kitty&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35155" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GME-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GME – Daily Chart" width="805" height="636" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GME-–-Daily-Chart.png 805w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GME-–-Daily-Chart-300x237.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GME-–-Daily-Chart-768x607.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GME – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of GME surged at the open above $40 and slumped back to $28. The original gap open at that level supports the price. Traders can keep an eye on that level for the week ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The struggling retailer surged 80% at the market open but fell back initially to a gain of 22%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move was driven by a Reddit post from Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, who posted a bet on GME to $116 million. He also showed a large holding of options trades expiring in late June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GameStop soared two weeks ago when Gill returned to the X social media platform for the first time in three years. The Reddit post was also the first in three years following his original analysis on YouTube and Reddit in 2021, which sparked a meme stock frenzy amongst retail investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday&#8217;s surge was also damaging for GME short sellers, who were on track to rack up almost $1 billion in paper losses, according to data from Ortex Technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $7 billion company needs help slowing sales in its core business of selling new and pre-owned video games. Video game sales have slowed over the last year, and consumers have also been downloading games digitally or streaming them more often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GameStop is expected to release its first-quarter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results </span><b>on June 11</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last month, the company said that first-quarter net sales would drop to $872 million and $892 million from $1.24 billion a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could be more volatility ahead, and it is a stock to keep on watchlists as it could trigger another type of meme stock mania in a broader range of stocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News agencies could not verify Gill&#8217;s post, which may be the cause of the selling that emerged after today&#8217;s opening.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GameStop shares jumped on Monday after the architect of the meme stock rally returned to Twitter after a three-year break. </span></p>
<p><b> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33349" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GME-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GME – Daily Chart" width="994" height="613" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GME-–-Daily-Chart.png 994w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GME-–-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GME-–-Daily-Chart-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" /></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GME – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GME shares experienced a significant gap from $17.55 Monday morning to trade above $38, only to slip back to $30. This rapid fluctuation underscores the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock market&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inherent volatility, a factor investors and analysts must remain vigilant about this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GameStop shares surged on Monday, reaching the highest levels since last July after a key person in the 2021 meme stock rally returned to Twitter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Gill, known by his alias Roaring Kitty, posted his first message on his X social media account in three years. Shares in the loss-making video game retailer had been trading at around $9 a share and soared as high as $81.25 in a matter of weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move in GameStop and other meme stocks led to significant losses at short-selling hedge funds and a period of stock market chaos. Gill ended up testifying before members of Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meme stock rally fizzled out, and shares have been in a persistent downtrend since 2021 when Gill stopped posting about the stock. The price closed at $17.56 on Friday with a share with a market valuation of $5.35 billion. Analysts still see that as severely overvalued for a company that&#8217;s only had two profitable quarters in the past three years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resurgence in GameStop&#8217;s stock price has again put short sellers in a precarious position. Financial analytics group Ortex has warned that Monday&#8217;s surge could result in losses exceeding $437 million for those who have bet against the company. Since the stock&#8217;s rally in May, short sellers have already incurred losses of over </span><b>$800</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> million, a stark reminder of the risks involved in such strategies.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gill&#8217;s return &#8220;seems to be the most likely suspect for the renewed interest today&#8230; but I would be careful not to characterise the participants in this phenomenon as investors,&#8221; said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. &#8220;There&#8217;s no fundamental change in any companies that are popularised in this phenomenon.&#8221;</span></p>
