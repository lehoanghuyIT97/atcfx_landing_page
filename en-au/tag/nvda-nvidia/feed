										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia (NAS100:NVDA) is worth looking at again this week ahead of an important Q1 earnings call.</p>

<p>The price of NVDA is trading at $131.29 on a quiet trading day after the Memorial holiday in the US. The earnings call comes with two overhead levels in play. If analysts are disappointed, then a correction could come. Either of those events is likely to make-or-break the stock market’s rebound from April.</p>
<p>Nvidia investors will be looking for real answers from management on how much US chip curbs on China exports will cost the company when it reports on Wednesday. A recent pullback in other regulations may also open up new markets.</p>
<p>In a fresh effort to stop Beijing&#8217;s access to cutting-edge technology, the Trump administration added export limits to Nvidia&#8217;s H20 chip. The company announced that a $5.5 billion impairment charge would be expected.</p>
<p>Nvidia does not break down its sales for the H20 chip, the only product it was allowed to sell to China, which accounted for 13% of its revenue last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary question around results and guidance is can Nvidia lift sales enough to offset the loss of H20 or China business,&#8221; Wedbush analysts said this week.</p>
<p>The company posted a very positive first quarter of Blackwell sales in its last earnings release and it may be a boost for the company if those sales can cover the China loss.</p>
<p>CEO Jensen Huang recently criticised the country’s wider export controls as a “failure”, saying they had backfired by spurring on Chinese developers. He also sought to soothe investor concerns about Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, which developed a lower-cost rival.</p>
<p>“Trump’s tariffs and trade policies are blotting out many other issues right now, but this one is yet to go away,” AJ Bell analysts said.</p>
<p>“The DeepSeek product challenged the consensus view that AI required more – more chipsets, more computing and server power, and more energy – and AI-related stocks have yet to fully recover their poise. Nvidia did offer fairly cautious guidance for the first quarter, which runs from February to April, but it has had the happy knack of beating estimates for the quarter,” they added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipmaker <strong>Nvidia (NAS100:NVDA)</strong> has its latest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released next week after a recent rebound in the stock. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50490" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50490" style="width: 787px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50490" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NVDA - Daily Chart" width="787" height="510" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Daily-Chart.png 787w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Daily-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Daily-Chart-768x498.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50490" class="wp-caption-text">NVDA &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rebound in NVDA stock saw an important clearing of the downtrend resistance at around $115. The earnings will be a test for the $143.37 level with the all-time highs ahead at $152.84. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia releases earnings in just under a week on May 28 and the stock will be the hottest topic in markets next week. The stock has recovered from an April slump and is now trying to push back to the previous highs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coming earnings could be a significant event that creates the next medium-term trend for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things to consider is a soothing of geopolitical worries on trade. The US and China have pulled back from its trade war and that can create an easier climate. Nvidia has also been moving to invest in manufacturing plants in the United States which can get the company on good terms with the current President and lessen its exposure to overseas issues. A recent trade visit between President Trump and Saudi Arabia has also led to partnership plans with Nvidia and the Middle Eastern state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, would be a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. The growth driver has been higher demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia was very bullish on its early sales of the new Blackwell AI platform. That could be a factor in an earnings surprise this quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors will also focus on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding trade policies and tariffs. The Trump administration has been said to be considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules. That could be another cap to Nvidia’s potential sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remains positive, NVDA could creep toward the first resistance line noted ahead of earnings and set up a retest of the highs with a positive earnings surprise.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia stock (NAS100:NVDA) has rallied after President Trump’s deals in Saudi opened the door for further exports.</p>
<figure id="attachment_50303" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50303" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50303" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="NVDA - Weekly Chart" width="778" height="541" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Weekly-Chart.png 778w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Weekly-Chart-300x209.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NVDA-Weekly-Chart-768x534.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50303" class="wp-caption-text">NVDA &#8211; Weekly Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>The price of NVDA has reached $135.34 after finding a base at $90. The downtrend resistance break around $118 can see the $150 high as a target.</p>
<p>Nvidia announced that it has signed a multi-year AI infrastructure deal with Humain, a startup launched by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. The two parties will build AI-powered factories, driven by hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips.</p>
<p>Investors are jumping back into NVDA as recent reports also bring hope that the White House will announce a deal that would enable Nvidia to sell its advanced chips in large volumes to the UAE.</p>
<p>These agreements will be vital for the company as they will support revenue that was lost in the export controls with China. The Humaine deal is among the $600 billion investment that Trump has secured on his recent visit to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>A research note from Citi said Nvidia’s deal with Saudi Arabia was “a good start to what’ll likely be a new country-to-country negotiation approach by the US government”.</p>
<p>Nvidia is set to release its latest earnings near the end of the month and it’s possible that the stock hovers near the record highs ahead of that date with a make-or-break report that can create a larger high, or a breakout to new highs.</p>
<p>Nvidia has beaten earnings expectations over the last four quarters by an average of 7.59% to 13.73%. The Saudi deal can provide a platform for Nvidia’s revenue and an upside surprise in demand could see the stock continue its run of upside gains over the last years.</p>
<p>In its previous earnings report, the company showed early promise with demand for its new Blackwell range of chips. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” management said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Nvidia (NYSE:NVDA)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw a price dip after the company was caught up in the trade wars. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48078" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NVDA-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NVDA - Daily Chart" width="903" height="558" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NVDA-Daily-Chart.png 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NVDA-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NVDA-Daily-Chart-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NVDA &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NVDA stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price appears to have found strong buyers around the $100 level but that will be tested on Wednesday after a 6% loss in after hours trading. NVDA is set to open around $105. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia tumbled in after hours trading after the company said the government will begin requiring a license to export its H20 chips to China, which escalates restrictions that the company has publicly opposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government informed Nvidia on Monday that such a license would be in effect “for the indefinite future”. Nvidia now expects to see a $5.5 billion hit during the fiscal first quarter from “inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The US government, or USG, informed NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, that the USG requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of the Company’s H20 integrated circuits,” the statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The H20 is a scaled-down chip that was designed to comply with US export regulations and has been Nvidia&#8217;s primary AI GPU available for sale in China after the H100/A100 were banned. The latest move is another blow for Nvidia’s plans to leverage sales and keep its growth valuation that has slipped since the second half of 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg News reported in January that the Trump admin was considering the latest step. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese tech companies including Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance had been scaling up H20 orders ahead of any potential chip regulations. That could start to feed into Nvidia sales over the coming year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chipmaker was the leader of a two-year AI-driven rally, which has run out of steam in recent months. Nvidia said on Monday it was planning to build AI servers worth up to $500 billion in the US over the next four years but the company has not escaped further export controls.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of Nvidia (NVDA) touched an all-time high on Tuesday as markets rallied from a recent correction.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-44620 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-1-1.jpg" alt="NVDA – Daily Chart" width="858" height="474" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-1-1.jpg 858w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-1-1-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-1-1-768x424.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NVDA – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of NVDA touched a new all-time high above $152, and the price pulled back sharply to $146 on the same day. That highlights resistance but may not last long if markets remain calm.</p>
<p>CEO Jensen Huang&#8217;s keynote speech at the tech industry&#8217;s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas sent shares higher to build on a record closing price on Monday.</p>
<p>Huang&#8217;s presentation provided updates on new Nvidia products, previewing what&#8217;s next for the artificial intelligence market. The key update from the AI chipmaker was a new artificial intelligence superchip called GB10 used in its new client supercomputer.</p>
<p>The supercomputer is small enough to fit on a desktop and priced at $3,000. The new product, ProjectDIGITS, will be available in May. The product will bring the company&#8217;s Blackwell line to smaller customers and could spark new income streams for Nvidia.</p>
<p>Analysts at Stifel, Wedbush, and Truist all reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock after Huang&#8217;s CES speech. Analysts now predict the stock will rise to an average of $172.80 over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Market darling of 2023-24, Nvidia rose to new highs in July and topped a $3 trillion market cap, making it the world&#8217;s largest company at one point. Investors hope that market gains will continue in a Trump-led presidency, which will get underway in full after the Jan 20 inauguration.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43981" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NVDA-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="NVDA – Weekly Chart" width="729" height="574" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NVDA-–-Weekly-Chart.png 729w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NVDA-–-Weekly-Chart-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NVDA – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the NVDA has dipped to $131.46 and is at risk of an unwind towards the $100 level if bad news emerges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The market&#8217;s most important stock is faltering,&#8221; CNBC headlines said on Monday. Shares are now down -3% in December, but -10% from the all-time high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A move to $100 would be a further -25% and would take the stock to a 38% Fibonacci correction from the lows around January 2023 when the artificial intelligence hype rally began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that correction happened, it would be a shock to the market and also drag many other technology firms lower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernstein analysts are among analysts still bullish on the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In front of the Blackwell product cycle, you have to be in Nvidia,” he wrote. “Demand looks clearly off the charts; 2025 seems likely to be an exceedingly good year”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beth Kindig, CEO of I/O Fund, said a successor to Blackwell may also be in the works. A product named Rubin &#8220;is rumored to be six months ahead of schedule, with a roll out as early as the first half of 2026,&#8221; she posted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chip demand may not be a problem for Nvidia and other companies, but valuations are looking stretched in tech stocks and a market shock may come from a broader market issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political turmoil appears to be happening all over the world with changes in Syria, South Korea, France, and now Germany. The largest economy in Europe has seen its Chancellor lose a vote of confidence. That brings debt risk to the eurozone and it is clearly a time to be cautious with global trends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia is priced at around 29x sales, compared to 3x for the sector average so there is room to move lower and still remain in a bullish trend.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NVDA &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><b>NVDA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has stalled at the $140.79 level as traders assess the valuation of the company. Recent earnings have seen a slowing of previous blockbuster growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Administration for Market Regulation is China’s monopoly regulator and said it is studying whether Nvidia is abiding by the terms of its conditional approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia uses Mellanox for connecting hardware to graphics chips in large servers, allowing them to function as a large processing system. Any action could harm the company’s business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear if Nvidia has broken the terms of the deal but the US government has forced Nvidia to stop sales of its most powerful products to Chinese customers. The latest probe follows US efforts to halt China’s access to high-tech American chips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move may also be in response to the threat of sanctions and China would see Nvidia as a very valuable chess piece ahead of Trump’s term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia reported $35.1 billion in sales during its Q3, with $5.4 billion coming from China, up from $4 billion at the same time last year. Nvidia can’t sell its most expensive hardware in China and it makes up less of its revenue. But any loss of sales would hurt the company’s valuation after it recently became the world’s most valuable company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broke a two-day losing streak on Wednesday and settled near the recent all-time highs. There is still a period of five weeks before Trump can take the helm of the country and there could be volatility when he does as markets expect some business-friendly actions to spur growth.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia (NYSE:NVDA) shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <span data-teams="true">are in fluctuation after its earnings release on Wednesday.</span></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43288" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NVDA-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NVDA - Daily Chart" width="997" height="574" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NVDA-Daily-Chart.png 997w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NVDA-Daily-Chart-300x173.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NVDA-Daily-Chart-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NVDA &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of NVDA jumped above the $150 level but has closed bearish on the day. The risk is to the downside of this company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia said its revenue came in at just above $35bn over the three months, which was above the $33bn consensus, but not the blowout that was hoped for. The company’s CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday after earnings: &#8220;The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell &#8211; in full production &#8211; are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analysts said ahead of the recent earnings update that a positive share price reaction would depend on management revenue guidance, with only an earnings beat and stretched outlook being a driver for further stock gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts also wanted reassurance that the new Blackwell rollout was on track to help justify the recent </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/market-news/nvidia-earnings-blackwell-delays-loom" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">share price recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the bottlenecks for Nvidia&#8217;s chip supply has been limited capacity for advanced production techniques at its manufacturing partner TSMC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revenue guidance for the fourth quarter from management was $37.5bn compared to a $37bn figure anticipated by analysts. Finance chief Colette Kress said Blackwell shipments are scheduled to begin during this quarter, but warned that supply constraints will likely linger well into next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will be shipping both Hopper and Blackwell systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and beyond,&#8221; Kress said. &#8220;Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest results are possibly a heads-up for investors that Nvidia’s growth boom has reached a plateau. That will have some questioning the growth valuations for Nvidia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyst Gene Munster said on X:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The key for how NVDA will trade tomorrow is to better understand the CFO&#8217;s comment that both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Munster expects NVDA to trade lower on Thursday as analysts consider the headwind of production constraints as the company currently trades at 55x earnings.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Nvidia (NYSE:NVDA)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will release its latest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday as fears over delays to its new Blackwell range linger. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43110" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NVDA – Daily Chart" width="769" height="577" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart.png 769w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NVDA – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NVDA shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is testing the previous high which now makes for support at the $140.79 level. Any disappointment in earnings or guidance could lead to a correction in the stock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia has beaten Wall Street revenue expectations for the last eight quarters, but analysts now expect a slower pace of growth. The focus will now be on how the company overcomes recent delays and supply chain issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chipmaker that has driven a sector rally in generative artificial intelligence is expected to report that its third-quarter sales surged 82.8% to $33.13 billion, analysts said. If analysts are correct, it would mark the slowest growth in six quarters, with its sales at least doubling in the previous five quarters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth for the company’s fourth quarter ending January, which will start to include sales of Nvidia&#8217;s new Blackwell chips, is likely to slow further to 67.6%. Design flaws in the new product have led to redesigns as customers report overheating issues. That now puts at risk the company’s previous prediction of &#8220;several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue&#8221; in the January quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley analysts expect to see Blackwell revenue coming in between $5 billion and $6 billion for the latest quarter. In comparison, Piper Sandler forecasts a range of $5 billion to $8 billion in revenue from the chips that have 30 times more speed than earlier models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia&#8217;s ability to deliver the new chips may also be limited by supply chain constraints, with capacity very tight going into 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes chips for Nvidia, said in July that supply issues were a concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to read this with any precision, to be clear,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analysts said, adding that even a one-week change in the timeline for delivering Blackwell chips could have a meaningful impact on revenue expectations.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia (NYSE:NVDA) stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was higher by almost 3% on Thursday after chip giant Nvidia announced a deal with Accenture (NYSE:ACN).</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41312" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NVDA – Daily Chart" width="903" height="601" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart.png 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NVDA-–-Daily-Chart-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NVDA – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of NVDA has been testing a downtrend resistance line in recent months. That level is the obstacle to further gains at the moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accenture has benefited from generative AI with bookings worth $3bn, while Nvidia’s revenue soared to a record high. The two companies are now expanding their existing partnership to accelerate the adoption of gen AI by businesses. Accenture has now launched an Nvidia business group to train 30,000 of its employees to guide clients in adopting AI tools. Accenture also set up a refinery in July which will enable companies to create custom models based on their organisational data.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accenture AI Refinery will create opportunities for companies to reimagine their processes and operations, discover new ways of working and scale AI solutions across the enterprise to help drive continuous change and create value,” said Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A new computing era has begun,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in August. “Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Nvidia stock needs to get above stubborn resistance and it may depend on geopolitics. An escalation in tensions is likely between Iran and Israel, with the US likely to assist. Chip companies rely on China for much of their income and need allies onside with the United States. That could get harder if a larger conflict draws in global powers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia’s pause since June has also hurt asset managers as the broader single stock-picking industry is up 20% on the year, but the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is up 22.1%. UBS estimates that Nvidia accounts for 1.43% of that 2.1% underperformance.</span></p>
