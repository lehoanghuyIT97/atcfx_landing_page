										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) released </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early on Thursday and continues a strong rebound in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42954" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DIS-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="DIS – Daily Chart" width="940" height="601" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DIS-–-Daily-Chart.png 940w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DIS-–-Daily-Chart-300x192.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DIS-–-Daily-Chart-768x491.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DIS – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><b>DIS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> touched lows in August and recovered to a price of $102.72. A recent break above the uptrend resistance line opened a path to the $105.85 level and the pre-market price for Disney was up 11%. The previous high for the company is around the $124 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The return of previous CEO Bob Iger has boosted the outlook for Disney with stronger cash flow and revenue. The entertainment giant reported revenue of $22.57 billion, up from $21.2 billion last year and narrowly above the $22.5 billion analysts expected. “The House of Mouse” said net income was $460 million, or $0.25 cents per share, which was below estimates of $1.74 billion, or $0.96 per share. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when accounting for around $1.5 billion in one-time restructuring charges, Disney&#8217;s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.14. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney&#8217;s streaming business was profitable again with an operating profit of $253 million after posting a profit for the first time last quarter. Chief Executive Officer Iger said Disney expects the services to &#8220;grow nicely in fiscal 2025&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s Experiences segment, which includes theme parks and cruise ships, was $8.24 billion, up slightly from $8.16 billion last year as consumers spent less on discretionary items due to economic constraints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iger is set to leave the company in 2026 and investors will keep that in mind as the turnaround plan continues to boost profitability.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was lower after management had enough votes to defeat Nelson Petz’s proxy fight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31840" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DIS-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="DIS – Weekly Chart" width="801" height="574" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DIS-–-Weekly-Chart.png 801w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DIS-–-Weekly-Chart-300x215.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DIS-–-Weekly-Chart-768x550.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DIS – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DIS stock dipped 0.55% from resistance around the $122 area, which will be important in the price’s following path after a 2024 rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney shareholders beat activist investor Nelson Peltz’s effort to win seats on the board of directors. Investors voted to elect all 12 company-backed board members, including CEO Bob Iger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voting results were announced Wednesday at the company’s 2024 virtual meeting of shareholders. Peltz, who leads investment firm Trian Partners, failed to get enough votes alongside the company’s other nominee, Jay Rasulo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peltz’s Trian had been campaigning to change Disney’s board, citing the media company’s stock underperformance over the last several years and its “botched” succession plan, in which Iger’s successor was fired. In response, Disney said its board is already conducting a diligent CEO selection process “led by successful CEOs with recent, highly praised succession experience.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peltz’s defeat is a vote of confidence in Iger and the current board and may raise the prospect of a hostile move for the firm. But there is also the prospect that Peltz will walk away and sell his holdings in the media giant. Iger said last month that the campaign was a distraction for management.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney had asked shareholders to reject Peltz and Rasulo for the board, saying Peltz “brings no media experience and has presented no strategic ideas for Disney”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the vote, Tesla founder Elon Musk had backed the efforts of Peltz, saying he would buy shares if the investor had been allowed on the board.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk said on X, “He would help reform the company, improve the quality of the product, and generally serve in the best interests of shareholders, as he has done at many other companies. “This would significantly improve Disney’s share price.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, management’s win could threaten recent stock gains. Some rallies may have been priced based on the belief that new management additions would help stabilise the share price.</span></p>
