										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we saw gains in the Chinese yuan against the US dollar, and the price is looking to confirm a bottom.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37310" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CNHUSD-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="CNHUSD – Weekly Chart" width="820" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CNHUSD-–-Weekly-Chart.png 820w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CNHUSD-–-Weekly-Chart-300x228.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CNHUSD-–-Weekly-Chart-768x583.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CNHUSD – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNHUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange rate bounced at the 0.1364 level and has resistance close by at 0.1375 for a more significant push higher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s inflation rate will be released at 9:30 a.m. HKT, and is expected to be 0.4%, up from 0.3% last week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China is on the brink of a significant policy meeting with the third plenum next week. This forum, known for unveiling long-term political and economic reforms, is a crucial event for the market. While major initiatives may not be on the agenda this time, the market is still likely to see some movement, particularly in </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are watching and waiting to see what gets delivered in the property, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors,&#8221; said Paul Bloxham, chief commodities economist at HSBC. Citigroup expects the plenum to provide further support for investment in the grid and clean energy, and extra help for the property market. China&#8217;s demand for </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/commodities/oil-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will also be an essential issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s inflation data will be released during the two-day testimony at Congress by the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell&#8217;s recent statement that rate cuts are not imminent in the US has already impacted the market, and his further remarks are likely to shape market sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Fed has stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,&#8221; Powell said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors may still be ahead of the game, thinking there will be a cut in September. China&#8217;s plenum next week will likely be a vital driver of the USDCNH around these </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/support-resistance-indicator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support and resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> levels.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35064" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CNHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="CNHUSD – Daily Chart" width="1126" height="613" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CNHUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 1126w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CNHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x163.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CNHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1024x557.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CNHUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x418.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1126px) 100vw, 1126px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">CNHUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CNH offshore rate tracks the CNY and aims to carve out a bottom against the USD. The support levels here return to the low in March, which should be strong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trading starts at 9:30 a.m. HKT with the release of China&#8217;s NBS manufacturing PMI data. Last month&#8217;s figure was 50.4, just above the 50 level, marking expansion or contraction. Analysts are looking for 50.5 this month, but a more substantial number could be like a rocket under the yuan.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s government has been hoping to challenge the hegemony of the US dollar. However, a survey by the Bank of Communications, China&#8217;s fifth-largest, said 47.7 percent of enterprises said the lack of interest among trading partners in using the yuan was the main hindrance to their performance. Despite that, the economic picture for government debt in the US may eventually force a rush to the yuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese authorities have helped the recent plunge in the yuan to boost exports, but they may be reaching a tipping point where investors see a bargain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PBOC has been trying to find the optimal level of yuan weakness to boost growth without triggering a market panic or capital outflows. The yuan has been steady for the year, but pressure has been building due to weak economic growth. That could change after the recent stimulus measures in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Chung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, told Reuters: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The PBOC may allow further yuan depreciation. The PBOC is focusing on slowing the pace of yuan depreciation — rather than defending a particular level — against the backdrop of a higher-for-longer dollar rate environment.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overseas investors may look to invest in property, and fund managers have been launching new Chinese funds to take advantage of the yuan&#8217;s weakness. Global fund launches in China have hit a record high, with eleven funds launching this year under the Qualified Domestic Limited Partner (QDLP) program. That figure is already higher than any previous year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent data also showed fund flows back into China-focused </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETFs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</span></p>
