<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend in Switzerland, the US and China agreed to significant tariff reductions. US President Donald Trump agreed to lower additional tariffs on Chinese imports imposed in April of this year from 145% to 30%. In return, China will reduce duties on US imports from 125% to 10%. These lower tariff rates will be in effect for 90 days. This temporary reduction in tariffs between the world&#8217;s two largest oil consumers has the potential to boost the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API weekly report revealed a 4.287 million barrel increase in US crude oil stockpiles for the week ending May 9, contrary to the previous week&#8217;s 4.49 million barrel decrease and market expectations of a 2.4 million barrel drop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPEC+ is expected to increase oil exports in May and June, potentially limiting price increases. Since April, OPEC&#8217;s oil production has risen more than anticipated, with a projected daily increase of 411,000 barrels in May.</span></p>

		<title>WTI Crude Oil Rises On Inventory Data, But Economic Concerns Loom</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the US benchmark, rose to $67.40 per barrel during Thursday&#8217;s early Asian session. This increase follows a rally driven by tighter-than-expected US oil inventories. However, gains may be capped due to concerns over a potential US economic slowdown and the impact of tariffs on global economic growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Crude Oil Inventories Rise</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), crude oil stockpiles in the US increased by 1.448 million barrels last week, which was less than the market consensus of a 2.1 million barrel rise. Despite this increase, gasoline and diesel draws were larger than expected, indicating stronger demand and potentially supporting higher </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic Concerns and Tariffs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the positive inventory data, fears of a US economic slowdown and the effects of President Trump&#8217;s tariffs on imports could limit further price increases. The tariffs are expected to increase costs for businesses, boost inflation, and erode consumer confidence, which could ultimately drag the WTI price down. Additionally, new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, including those from major suppliers like Canada and Mexico, are set to take effect, further complicating the economic outlook.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">WTI 4-Hour chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brent crude</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> futures settled $1.46 higher or 1.86% at $79.87 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up $1.48 or 2% at $75.55.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the European Central Bank proceeded with its first interest rate cut since 2019, citing progress in tackling inflation but cautioning that the fight was far from over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denmark&#8217;s central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.35%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts in the US saw the European rate cuts as a likely precursor to Fed rate cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower fuel costs and easing post-pandemic supply snags have helped drive inflation down to 2.6% in the 20 euro-using countries from 10% in late 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are now less confident than they were a few weeks ago that inflation had retreated enough for the ECB to institute a significant easing cycle. In the US, economists predict the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September, according to Reuters&#8217; May 31-June five poll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today the ECB rate cuts are helping, and casting a view that the Fed will finally follow suit here in the US as well which is supportive, but both central banks are cutting in the face of a slowing economy which is not necessarily supportive of oil demand,&#8221; said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week. However, the Labor Department said first-quarter unit labour costs grew less than previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this shows a cooling labour market, it is unlikely to push the Fed to start rate cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, trading house Trafigura&#8217;s chief economist Saad Rahim said the OPEC+ decision to phase out some output cuts, combined with solid fuel supplies, has decreased oil prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed on Sunday to extend most production cuts into 2025. However, they left room for voluntary cuts from eight members to gradually unwound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that OPEC+ could pause or reverse production increases if it decides the market is not strong enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the group might adjust the deal if necessary, adding that the post-meeting price drop was caused by misinterpretation of the agreement and &#8220;speculative factors&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oil markets have overreacted to the mildly negative OPEC+ meeting outcome. Demand indicators have certainly softened somewhat recently, but are not falling off a cliff,&#8221; Barclays analyst Amarpreet Singh wrote in a note. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, a merchant vessel reported an explosion near it in the Red Sea on Thursday about 19 nautical miles west of the Yemeni port city of Mokha, British security firm Ambrey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vessel fit the target profile of Yemeni Houthi militants, Ambrey said in a note. Militants have attacked ships off the country&#8217;s coast for several months in solidarity with Palestinians fighting Israel in Gaza. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vessel was en route from Europe to the United Arab Emirates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This puts more risk on top of a market that was already nervous,&#8221; said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. &#8220;And if it turns out to be an oil tanker, this will probably raise the stakes,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
