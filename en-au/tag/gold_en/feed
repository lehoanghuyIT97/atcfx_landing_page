<h2><strong>Gold Prices Hit Record Highs Despite Strong Dollar</strong></h2>
<p>Gold prices (<a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XAUUSD</a>) surged to unprecedented levels on Monday, defying a stronger U.S. dollar after President Donald Trump announced fresh trade tariffs targeting commodity imports. The escalating trade tensions fueled investor demand for safe-haven assets, particularly gold.</p>
<p>As of 3:30 p.m. ET (20:30 GMT), spot gold climbed 1.5% to $2,904.19 per ounce, after reaching an all-time high of $2,911.44 earlier in the day. Gold futures for April delivery also soared, rising 1.6% to $2,933.61 per ounce.</p>
<h2><strong>U.S. Tariff Announcements Drive Gold Demand</strong></h2>
<p>The surge in gold prices follows President Trump’s announcement on Sunday of a 25% tariff on all aluminum and steel imports to the U.S. This move has heightened concerns over potential disruptions to global trade, prompting investors to flock to gold as a reliable hedge against economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump indicated <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/trump-2025-administration-impact-on-key-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans for reciprocal tariffs</a>, aiming to align U.S. import duties with those of its trading partners. This announcement closely follows the implementation of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, which triggered retaliatory measures from Beijing.</p>
<h2><strong>Escalating Trade War Fuels Economic Concerns<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The new tariffs have intensified fears of an escalating trade war between the world’s largest economies. Analysts warn that prolonged trade conflicts could stifle global economic growth and disrupt international trade flows.</p>
<p>“Gold has already surged over 10% year-to-date, achieving consecutive record highs. Concerns over tariffs potentially driving higher inflation and slower economic growth are boosting demand for safe-haven assets like gold,” noted analysts at ING.</p>
<h2><strong>Precious Metals Market Sees Broad Gains<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The rally in gold prices also lifted other precious metals. Silver futures edged up 0.1% to $32.468 per ounce, while platinum futures advanced 1.3% to $1,034.40 per ounce.</p>
<h2><strong>Impact on Industrial Metals Amid Market Uncertainty<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Industrial metals faced mixed reactions amid the tariff news. Benchmark copper futures on the London Metal Exchange remained flat at $9,468.00 per ton, whereas March copper futures gained 2.4% to $4.7008 per pound.</p>
<p>“With Trump back in the White House, market volatility and unpredictability are at heightened levels. Ongoing trade disputes are likely to dampen global growth and weaken demand for industrial metals,” ING added.</p>
<h2><strong>Federal Reserve, Inflation Data in Focus<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Looking ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver his semiannual monetary policy testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. Market participants will closely monitor his comments for insights into how potential tariffs might impact the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Economists and Federal Reserve officials have cautioned that the new tariffs, which will primarily affect U.S. importers, could contribute to rising inflation, reducing the likelihood of interest rate cuts. Additionally, January&#8217;s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, set to be released later this week, is expected to influence future interest rate decisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gold-price">Gold prices</a> dipped on Friday, marking a lower weekly close as rising US Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s hawkish stance overshadowed the yellow metal. Spot gold declined by 0.7% to $2,614.40 per ounce, while February gold futures slipped 0.9%, settling at $2,630.36 per ounce.</p>
<p>The trading atmosphere remained subdued, with many institutional investors winding down for the holiday season. The year-end slowdown typically results in thinner trading volumes and muted price activity. Additionally, the lack of significant economic data or major policy announcements toward the year&#8217;s end often limits market catalysts.</p>
<p>Despite Friday’s dip, gold was still on track to inch up by 0.3% for the week, recovering slightly from a 1% decline in the previous week. However, a stronger US dollar bolstered by the Fed’s reaffirmation of restrictive monetary policy continues to weigh heavily on gold’s performance.</p>
<h2>Rising Yields Push Gold Prices Down</h2>
<p>The US Dollar Index softened slightly on Friday, retracting overnight gains but remained near its two-year high. However, sharply higher Treasury yields outpaced any potential boost from the dollar’s weakness, keeping gold under pressure.</p>
<p>Typically, gold prices benefit from a weaker dollar, as it makes the metal more affordable for international buyers. However, higher interest rates, spurred by hawkish Fed policy, make interest-bearing assets like bonds more appealing than non-yielding gold, leading to sustained downward pressure.</p>
<p>This week’s gold decline followed the Federal Reserve’s revised projections of only two interest rate cuts in 2025, down from the previously anticipated four. The adjustment signaled the Fed&#8217;s intent to maintain tighter monetary policy for longer, reinforcing an environment less favorable for gold.</p>
<p>Other precious metals mirrored gold’s downward trajectory. Platinum futures plunged by 3.6% to $919.90 per ounce, while silver futures dropped 1.5% to $29.935 per ounce.</p>
<h2>Copper Gains on Supply Constraints but Faces Dollar Headwinds</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, industrial metals like copper saw mixed performance. Copper prices edged higher after reports highlighted a continued shortage of copper concentrates in China. Reuters revealed that leading Chinese copper smelters have reduced their processing charge guidance for the first quarter of 2025, reflecting tightening supply. The new treatment and refining rates were set at $25 per metric ton and 2.5 cents per pound, significantly lower than the fourth-quarter figures of $35 per ton and 3.5 cents per pound.</p>
<p>This supply constraint drove benchmark copper futures on the London Metal Exchange up 0.4%, closing at $8,995.00 per ton. However, February copper futures fell slightly by 0.1% to $4.1242 per pound, as a strong dollar capped potential gains.</p>
<p>Although supply shortages suggest potential support for copper prices in the coming months, the robust dollar continues to challenge the broader industrial metals market, limiting immediate upside potential.</p>
<p>Outlook: As 2024 concludes, gold and other precious metals may remain vulnerable to fluctuations in Treasury yields and the dollar. Meanwhile, copper and other industrial metals will likely hinge on global supply-demand dynamics, particularly in key markets like China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold prices (Spot Gold: XAUUSD)</a> reached an all-time high on Wednesday, driven by heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid growing political uncertainties in the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>Initially, gold saw a subdued start to the week as a less intense-than-anticipated Israeli attack on Iran suggested a possible easing in Middle Eastern tensions.</p>
<p>However, the upcoming <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/financial-events/us-presidential-election-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 U.S. presidential election</a> on November 5 has kept the demand for safe-haven investments strong. The political uncertainty in Japan also rose after a coalition led by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in a recent election, further fueling the demand for safe-haven assets.</p>
<p>Spot gold increased by 0.4% to $2,785.47 per ounce, hitting a record high of $2,790.01 earlier in the day, while December gold futures rose 0.6% to $2,796.85 per ounce.</p>
<p>With the U.S. presidential election drawing near, markets remained tense as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris continued in a close race. Recent polls showed Trump gaining a slight edge, though analysts considered the outcome too close to predict.</p>
<p>In Japan, the LDP&#8217;s recent election loss introduced further uncertainty, as it must seek alliances with regional parties to govern effectively, potentially weakening its influence. In the Middle East, tensions persisted, with Iran vowing to retaliate for recent Israeli strikes and Israel maintaining military actions against Hamas and Hezbollah, suggesting limited room for de-escalation.</p>
<p>Economic and interest rate data, such as the U.S. third-quarter GDP data, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge, and nonfarm payrolls, are playing a significant role in shaping investor sentiment. These releases precede a Federal Reserve meeting, where a modest rate cut of 25 basis points is anticipated. Lower U.S. interest rates are typically favourable for non-yielding assets like gold.</p>
<p>Safe-haven demand also supported other <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precious metals</a>, with platinum futures down 3.7% to $1,020.20 per ounce and silver futures falling 1.5% to $33.94 per ounce. In industrial metals, London Metal Exchange copper futures rose by 0.1% to $9,564.00 per ton but faced significant losses for October.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Gold &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of gold has moved to touch the recent breakout trend line and has moved back toward the recent highs around the $2,525 level. The recent support is vital for the path forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has been moving higher as the Federal Reserve moves to a dovish tone and signals interest rate cuts ahead. PCE pricing data on Friday from the United States will have a bearing on inflation and gold’s outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold had slipped earlier in the week with a stronger US dollar as investors buy the US currency for month-end portfolio rebalancing. US data this week has failed to boost gold with GDP data coming in stronger at 3% versus 2.8% and that was dollar positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders will now look at the inflation figures on Friday, which may provide further evidence for the Fed Chair Jerome Powell after he said last week the “time has come” to ease borrowing costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest World Gold Council report said global gold </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETFs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced their strongest month since April 2022, with $3.7bn in July, the third consecutive monthly inflow. Money came in from all regions with Western funds leading the way </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent inflows and the rise in the price of gold have pushed the total AUM of global gold ETFs to $246bn. Collective holdings rebounded to 3,154t, which is the highest since January </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North American funds saw inflows of US$2bn, which reversed minor outflows from May and June. Continued tension between Russia and Ukraine has fuelled the rally in bullion, alongside a failure to secure a ceasefire in the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The path ahead in gold will rely on these dynamics with the inflation figures on Friday possibly confirming a rate cut in September. A lower-than-expected inflation number could drive gold further.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold ETFs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finally saw investors return after 12 months of outflows as prices hit new record highs. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35574" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gold-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="Gold – Daily Chart" width="913" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gold-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 913w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gold-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x204.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gold-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x523.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GOLD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw a bounce fade out at the $2,235 level and may look to test the $2,282 support level. If that level breaks, then the move lower could be swift. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Gold Council&#8217;s latest monthly report, physically backed gold exchange-traded funds saw their first monthly inflow in a year, amounting to </span><b>$529 million</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Strength in the price of the</span> <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">precious metals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and inflows pushed gold ETF&#8217;s assets under management (AUM) to US$234 billion, up 2%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flows were different between the United States and Europe/Asia in May. Gold flows in North America returned to negative in May at -$139 million following two consecutive monthly inflows. However, compared to the region&#8217;s outflows in prior months, the negative print in May was the smallest since December 2019. Total outflows in North America for the year in North America reached $4.3 billion. This was second only to Europe, driven by large fund selling in January and February.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European inflows in May were $287 million, ending a twelve-month losing streak. Asia recorded the 15th consecutive monthly inflow, with an additional $398 million in May. However, that was the region&#8217;s most minor inflow since November 2023. China was once again the driver in the area, with $253 million in demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asia is the only region with inflows for 2024, with $2.6 billion. Gold surged in May as investors turned to safe-haven assets with tensions in the Middle East. A slow move toward a ceasefire has taken some demand out of the price of bullion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets were also expecting an early rate cut from the US central bank in June, but that has been pushed back to September as soon as possible. This week&#8217;s favourable inflation data has slightly turned the tables, but gold is not benefiting from that change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Powell acknowledging that the FOMC had a chance to change projections after seeing today&#8217;s data and his emphasis that it&#8217;s ONE good report sends a clear message: &#8216;Don&#8217;t send out the Pivot Party invitations just yet,&#8221; said Tai Wong, a New York-based metals trader. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gold will continue to trade with employment and inflation data.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold prices</a> in Asia rose slightly, hovering within a stable range observed over the past two weeks. The market is rife with speculation about when the Federal Reserve will commence lowering interest rates.</p>
<p>In the industrial metals market, copper prices hit a near one-month low, erasing most of their gains in May when they reached record highs. This price decline stemmed from growing concerns about slowing global economic growth.</p>
<p>Gold experienced some relief as the US dollar fell to its lowest level in two months this week. However, the dollar showed signs of a mild recovery on Wednesday.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35288" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GOLD-888474290.png" alt="GOLD – 4-Hour Chart" width="1121" height="645" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GOLD-888474290.png 1121w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GOLD-888474290-300x173.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GOLD-888474290-1024x589.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GOLD-888474290-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">GOLD – 4-Hour Chart</span></p>
<p>Spot gold increased by 0.4% to $2,337.35 per ounce, while gold futures with an August expiration date gained 0.4% to $2,357.05 per ounce by 00:46 ET (04:46 GMT). Despite these gains, spot gold remained within a narrow range of $2,300 to $2,350 per ounce, a range it has maintained for nearly two weeks after experiencing a sharp decline from record highs reached in May.</p>
<p>Traders hesitated to make substantial bets on gold, even as weak US economic data fueled speculation that the Fed could begin cutting interest rates in September. A disappointing job openings report on Tuesday, following weak purchasing managers index data and a downgraded gross domestic product reading, further contributed to this sentiment.</p>
<p>Traders were increasingly confident in a September rate cut. However, markets remained cautious, anticipating the release of nonfarm payroll data on Friday, which is expected to provide more definitive information about the labour market.</p>
<p>The Fed is scheduled to meet next week, and it is widely anticipated that rates will remain unchanged due to persistent US inflation.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precious metals</a> also exhibited volatile price movements on Wednesday. Platinum futures fell by 0.2% to $995.50 per ounce, while silver futures gained 0.8% to $29.863 per ounce. Both metals had experienced significant losses on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the industrial metals market, benchmark copper futures on the London Metal Exchange increased slightly to $9,975.50 per tonne, and one-month copper futures rose to $4.5497 per pound. Both contracts were close to their lowest levels in a month, having largely erased the gains achieved in May when they briefly reached record highs.</p>
<p>Bearish sentiment toward copper prevailed as moderate economic readings from the US and China raised concerns about slowing global growth, negatively impacting copper demand.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35121" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gold-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="Gold – Daily Chart" width="898" height="637" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gold-–-Daily-Chart.png 898w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gold-–-Daily-Chart-300x213.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gold-–-Daily-Chart-768x545.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">GOLD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p>Gold was rejected at the $2,350 level and has closed against support around the $2,325 level. If buyers do not emerge, there is support below $2,300.</p>
<p>Gold has cooled off but still posted its fourth monthly gain as investors anticipated a change in US monetary policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold is down despite the friendly PCE report and softer consumer spending, which could suggest near-term exhaustion in what has been a remarkable rally in 2024,&#8221; metals trader Tai Wong told Reuters.</p>
<p>Central bank purchases have been substantial, and geopolitical tensions have been high. Friction between the United States and China has seen the latter reduce its vast holdings of US treasuries and park the money in gold. India has also been a big buyer, and it has helped to offset outflows from gold exchange-traded funds this year.</p>
<p>Less money has flowed to gold ETF funds because stocks remain near record highs in the US, and investors have been seeking to capitalise on that rally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, changes in gold ETF holdings have often been triggered by major risk-off events (when the appetite for risk declines) and by cycles of easier monetary policy. Our analysts expect ETF holdings to climb once the Fed starts cutting rates,&#8221; an analysis from Goldman Sachs said.</p>
<p>The recent rise in the price of gold has affected the consumer market, with watchmaker Rolex raising the price of its watches as gold has soared. However, Goldman also expects support for gold to rise in India due to the &#8220;wealth effect&#8221; as consumers continue to get richer from a growing economy in a country with a significant domestic gold market.</p>
<p>For now, gold is on the backfoot after four months of gains, and this week&#8217;s support could determine the size of the correction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gold was higher in the US session with weak jobs data and another peace failure in Israel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33149 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gold-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="Gold – Daily Chart" width="894" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gold-–-Daily-Chart.webp 894w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gold-–-Daily-Chart-300x209.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gold-–-Daily-Chart-768x534.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Gold – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold price</a> has risen to $2,331 in the US session, and resistance now sits at the $2,352 level for another breakout.</p>
<p>Weekly initial unemployment claims in the United States were higher on Wednesday, reaching the highest level since August. First-time filings for the week ending May 4 were at 231,000, a 22,000 increase from a week earlier. Economists were expecting a rise to 210k.</p>
<p>The latest data follows last week&#8217;s weaker US payrolls data, and investors are now projecting less strength in the economy, which could bring forward the pace of Federal Reserve rate cuts.</p>
<p>Even if the Federal Reserve is slower to move, the like of the European and British central banks seem in more of a hurry to lower interest rates. The Bank of England said on Thursday it may cut its benchmark rate as early as June, with inflation &#8220;moving in the right direction&#8221;.</p>
<p>Gold rose on the expectation of lower interest rates but also because another round of ceasefire talks in the Middle East has faltered.</p>
<p>Latest news reports had an Israeli official saying: &#8220;This round of Gaza truce and hostage-release talks in Cairo has ended&#8221;. The plan now is to &#8220;press ahead with the operation in Rafah and elsewhere in the Gaza Strip&#8221;.</p>
<p>US President Joe Biden has said publicly for the first time that the US will withhold weapons from Israel if its forces continue with its invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made it clear that if they go into Rafah&#8230; I&#8217;m not supplying the weapons,&#8221; Biden told CNN on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gold could eventually surprise investors because exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for bullion saw their 11th straight month of declines, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Total holdings in gold ETFs slipped to 3,080 tonnes, the lowest amount for more than four years.</p>
<p>That means the price is being supported by institutional buying and central banks. A move to the all-time highs again could see retail investors return.</p>

Despite the robust economic strength in the United States, this surge in the yellow metal, which had previously dampened hopes for an early rate cut, is a significant market trend.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31776" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GOLD-256.png" alt="gold chart" width="1157" height="644" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GOLD-256.png 1157w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GOLD-256-300x167.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GOLD-256-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GOLD-256-768x427.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1157px) 100vw, 1157px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GOLD &#8211; 4 Hour chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot gold jumped by 0.9% to $2,249.95 per ounce, and gold futures expiring in June increased by 0.8% to settle at $2,257.10. However, the price had reached as high as $2,286.35 during intraday trading before the release of US manufacturing data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unexpected expansion in US manufacturing activity, which increased </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasury yields</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the dollar, was a critical factor in Monday&#8217;s record-high gold prices. This unpredictability in market dynamics adds an intriguing element to the gold price surge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ISM manufacturing purchasing managers&#8217; index unexpectedly improved from 47.8 to 50.3. This exceeded the threshold of 50, signalling an expansion in manufacturing for the first time since September 2022. Subsequently, the probability of a rate cut in June declined from 64% last week to 56%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the robust economic data, the core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred measure of inflation, experienced an unexpected slowdown in February. This suggests that the recent surge in inflation may have been an anomaly relative to the ongoing disinflation trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent note, Morgan Stanley expressed its view, stating it maintains its forecast of an initial rate cut in June. The firm believes that core PCE will average 0.22% from March to May. These lower figures will provide sufficient evidence of sustainable disinflation toward the target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sentiment for -haven gold has also been influenced by geopolitical tensions, particularly following reports from Iranian and Syrian media that an Israeli strike targeted a building near the Iranian embassy in Syria&#8217;s capital on Monday.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold prices</a> made history in Thursday&#8217;s Asian trading session, a feat attributed mainly to the impact of Jerome Powell&#8217;s statements. The Chair of the Federal Reserve hinted at potential interest rate cuts in 2024, a move that sent shockwaves through the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold&#8217;s</a> upward momentum, which began last week, shows no signs of slowing down. The market is abuzz with anticipation of future interest rate cuts in the US, a sentiment that is bolstering gold&#8217;s appeal. Many market participants now speculate that the Federal Reserve could initiate its rate reduction cycle as early as June.</p>
<p>In detail, spot gold increased over 0.4%, reaching a new zenith at $2,161.19 per ounce. Concurrently, futures contracts for gold set to expire in April soared to an apex of $2,168.10 per ounce.</p>
<p>Analysts at ANZ have highlighted that a robust influx of investor interest backs this recent surge. This is attributed to the dual factors of anticipated lower interest rates and pronounced demand for gold as a safe haven amidst the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions and a landscape of economic uncertainty.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Rate Cut Revelations: Powell&#8217;s Meets Kashkari&#8217;s Caution</h2>
<p>During his recent testimony, Jerome Powell confirmed the Federal Reserve&#8217;s intention to reduce interest rates in 2024, signalling a favourable environment for non-yielding assets like gold. However, Powell&#8217;s remarks offered limited insights regarding the precise timing and magnitude of the anticipated rate cuts, emphasising that the trajectory of the US economy and inflation trends would critically influence any decisions on monetary policy adjustments.</p>
<p>Powell underscored the necessity for more concrete evidence that inflation is progressing towards the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual target of 2%. Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, echoed this sentiment and indicated scepticism towards the possibility of more than one or two rate reductions within the year. Kashkari&#8217;s stance, reflecting concerns over persistent inflation, aligns with the cautious approach adopted by several Fed officials in recent discussions.</p>
<p>Despite a significant decline in the dollar&#8217;s value after Powell&#8217;s testimony, it experienced a slight rebound during the Asian trading hours, particularly following Kashkari&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>By 23:33 ET (04:33 GMT), gold prices had retreated from their intraday peaks. The anticipation of enduringly high-interest rates has imposed constraints on gold&#8217;s potential for sustained record-breaking performance over the last year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other precious metals</a> exhibited less volatility in the Asian market. Platinum futures held steady at approximately $913.80 an ounce, while silver futures experienced a marginal decrease to $24.477 an ounce.</p>
<p>Investors and market analysts are now paying attention to the forthcoming nonfarm payrolls data, expected on Friday. This data is anticipated to provide further insights into the state of the labour market,</p>
<p>which remains a critical factor for the Federal Reserve when considering adjustments to interest rates. The labour market&#8217;s strength is a key indicator of overall economic health and has significant implications for policy decisions aimed at managing inflation and fostering sustainable growth. As such, the upcoming release of the nonfarm payrolls report is eagerly awaited, with stakeholders keen to gauge its impact on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s rate-setting trajectory and, consequently, on the investment landscape for gold and other precious metals.</p>
