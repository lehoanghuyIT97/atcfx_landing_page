										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple (NYSE:AAPL) shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continue to tumble as its two most important markets do battle with trade wars.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47626" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="920" height="610" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png 920w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x199.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-768x509.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of AAPL stock failed above the previous resistance at $236.87 and has now dipped through support at $198.25. The market may look for a short-term bounce as we probe lower levels toward $170.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple stock was set for another tough day on Monday as panic mode continued in the media over the weekend. The company was sold off as new tariffs were unveiled over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump&#8217;s tariffs have affected every country that supplies components to Apple. That means Apple now has to pay more for its imports, and is unlikely to avoid raising its prices to match the strain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market also reacted to the prospect of American consumers facing higher prices, and saw high volume sell-offs ahead of the weekend. The fallout is equally hitting other technology firms as analysts look at supply chains for each sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his tariff announcement, Trump spoke about Apple and their planned investment of $500 billion in the US &#8220;They never spent money like that here,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple has spent years, and its suppliers have spent billions, trying to disconnect from China. However, the country still dominates Apple’s supply chain and that is unlikely to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading into Monday’s session, markets will be focused on news that China will impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting on April 10. The country is hitting back with its own level of tariffs and markets are likely to be on edge over the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple shares lost around 14% of their value over the past week as tech stocks continued to suffer from a lack of AI adoption and deeply overbought conditions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple (NYSE:AAPL)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is said to be considering major iPhone updates, according to the Wall St Journal.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43982" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="928" height="562" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png 928w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x182.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-768x465.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAPL started 2024 with a five-month dip to around May and then began a sharp rally to $236. Price corrected once more but has now soared to an all-time high above $250.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple is said to be preparing to make major changes to its iPhone lineup and maybe some of its other products. Beginning next year, the company aims to release a thinner iPhone, with a design slimmer than the current 8-millimeter models. The updated device is also expected to come in at a lower price than previous iPhone Pro models and will include a simplified camera. Reports said the company wants to boost demand for its product offerings and drive future growth, while cutting costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple is also working on two foldable devices, with a 19-inch laptop-sized model and a smaller model that would act as a foldable iPhone. The company was said to have seen delays with its foldable technology but may be releasing it in 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple is heavily reliant on its iPhone segment for more than 50% of its overall sales. A slowdown in those sales led to a slowdown in 2024 and some volatility in the share price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also had issues with its Vision Pro product, which is a high-end virtual reality headset. That was a move to new products but the headset’s high price of more than $3,000 led to production cuts on weak demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are rumours of a more affordable version of the Vision Pro that could be powered by an iPhone. That could give the device more commercial appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The valuation of Apple is currently around 20% higher than its 5-year average and any sales slowdown or delays could hurt the recent rise to all-time highs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple is set to release its latest quarterly earnings report on Thursday after the market close.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38648" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="826" height="650" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.webp 826w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x236.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-768x604.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" />AAPL – Daily Chart</p>
<p>AAPL stock dipped in July but the stock has still seen a strong recovery since the lows in April.</p>
<p>The latest results will be important for the iPhone maker, which has struggled with weak demand and rising competition in China over the past year. Analysts are positive that the company can see a return to growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts also have an eye on growth in Apple Intelligence, the company&#8217;s upcoming AI system, alongside demand for the iPhone 16.</p>
<p>“iPhone demand is likely stabilizing in China, according to supply-chain checks Wedbush conducted in Asia. That could set up the company to initially ship around 90 million iPhone 16s, higher than the consensus of 80-84 million,” Wedbush analysts said.</p>
<p>Growth could also come from AI products, with the company’s OpenAI partnership. The company said AI tools added to Apple products could add another $30 to $40 each share of Apple stock.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly believe June will be the last negative growth quarter for China with a growth turnaround beginning in the September quarter. China remains the linchpin of growth for Apple and now this key region is set to see growth once against starting with iPhone 16 in our view,&#8221; Wedbush said.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley are also upbeat with a record 700 million iPhones that are at least three years old by the end of the fiscal year. That could provide Apple with a strong upgrade cycle. Apple Intelligence could help the firm sell as many as 235 million iPhones over the 2025 fiscal year, followed by 262 million iPhones in the 2026 fiscal year, analysts said.</p>
<p>Dan Ives of Wedbussaid Apple could see “monumental” demand due to the upgrader cycle. If Apple can expand its AI capabilities across 2.2 billion active devices, it could be a big player in the consumer AI space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple&#8217;s announcement of new AI tools led to a surge in stock and new all-time highs.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35458" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="1048" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png 1048w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x178.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-1024x608.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAPL shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surged almost 6% on Tuesday after breaking through the previous all-time high at $199.57.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple&#8217;s announcement of Apple Intelligence at its WWDC conference revealed some familiar tools and new ideas. Apple said its AI tools would be free, but investors are unsure if that will always happen. The new Rewrite, Image Playground, and Genmoji tools will be free and integrated into the iPhone&#8217;s OS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also said there would be some ChatGPT integration into iOS 18, which Apple says is &#8220;free without creating an account.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the current stock price of $205 holds out, Apple will add more than $180 billion to its market value. At more than $3.15 trillion, its market capitalization is now only $40 billion short of Microsoft as the world&#8217;s most valuable company. Nvidia is now number three in market value at $2.93 trillion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple has created an impressive bounce from the lows of around $160 in April. At its annual developer event, it announced an improved Siri virtual assistant that can answer a broader range of queries and perform more complicated tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 13 analysts raised their price targets on Apple&#8217;s shares after the developer event, saying the latest features could encourage a renewal in Apple&#8217;s iPhone sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some analysts were sceptical. &#8220;Perhaps there may be enough in the new and improved Siri-powered, intelligently Apple devices to stanch some of the device revenue that&#8217;s been haemorrhaging lately, but there isn&#8217;t enough to create a new band of followers,&#8221; said Forrester&#8217;s Dipanjan Chatterjee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surge in Apple shares also boosted the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tech index, up 0.60%, outperforming the broader </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35024" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="958" height="580" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png 958w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x182.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-768x465.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple&#8217;s stock price trades at $191.67 after a recent earnings-driven surge following the release. If the WWDC impresses, the company will face two intense resistance levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s WWDC 2024, heavily rumoured to be focused on artificial intelligence, could be a game-changer for Apple. If a big announcement is made, the company&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price could see a significant rally, underlining the importance of this event for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparison, Apple is valued at 7.6x sales, while Microsoft is valued at 13.5%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple&#8217;s released schedule for its developer conference could focus on speed. The new iPad Pro only features the company&#8217;s new M4 silicon chip. However, it will likely be added to the MacBook Pro and the Mac Studio devices soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts need high-level AI tools from AI, and Bloomberg&#8217;s Mark Gurman expects to see basic AI features like transcribing voice memos or auto-generated emojis. A rumoured partnership with OpenAI could also be announced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading analyst Daniel Ives maintains a bullish stance on Apple&#8217;s stock before the upcoming conference. His positive outlook, backed by recent supply chain checks, suggests that a successful WWDC could significantly boost the share price, potentially setting the stage for a strong earnings release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ives reiterated a Buy on AAPL stock last week, while he raised his price target on the company to $275 from $250. That would be a gain of around 45% from the current price.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple is set to release its second quarter earnings on Thursday with investors looking for a bright outlook after a sales slump.</span></p>
<p><b> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32746" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AAPL-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL - Daily Chart" width="930" height="634" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AAPL-Daily-Chart.png 930w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AAPL-Daily-Chart-300x205.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AAPL-Daily-Chart-768x524.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAPL trades at $173.49 and can start a new bullish posture with a jump over the $176 level. Disappointing sales could see the stock heading back toward $166. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were boosted on Monday as Bernstein upgraded the company ahead of the earnings release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;AAPL has de-rated significantly amid a weak iPhone 15 cycle and fears that Apple’s China business is structurally impaired,&#8221; analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote. &#8220;We believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note that historically Apple’s China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Apple to report earnings of $1.51 per share on $90.6B in revenue. Bernstein, like Wedbush Securities, believes that there will be headwinds in the short-term but sees some positives on the horizon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both see a return to growth in the second half with the release of the iPhone 16 and the June WWC conference potentially bringing an AI-led boost to the company’s share price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernstein did cite a &#8220;major escalation&#8221; in tensions between the US and China as a threat if there are further export bans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first event of the year for Apple will be the “Let Loose” event on May 7, where a new iPad and pencil is expected. A positive earnings release could set the company up for further gains around those events in May and June.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple&#8217;s shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are down around 10% year-to-date, but some analysts are hopeful of a turnaround in the year&#8217;s second half. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAPL&#8217;s crucial support level looms around $165.50, determining the stock&#8217;s path over the coming weeks. The market will likely attempt to test this over the next week, with support starting at $150. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple has suffered from a decline in iPhone sales in China, its key overseas market. Market share gains from domestic rivals and geopolitical tensions have added to Apple&#8217;s problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedbush Securities analysts are still bullish on Apple but pointed to a &#8220;black cloud&#8221; hanging over the company after it lost over </span><b>$200 billion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in market value in 2024.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the stock still has a chance to recover this year, analysts said, maintaining their &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating with a </span><b>$250</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price target, the highest on Wall Street.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company singled out some reasons it could do well, with iPhone sales potentially stronger overall. Wedbush said the 2024 estimates are &#8220;hittable&#8221; despite some conservative 2025 estimates for iPhone sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also see the potential for pent-up demand for iPhones, as many users are due for an upgrade. Wedbush estimated that around 270 million iPhones could be swapped out for a newer version, especially with the iPhone 16 being released later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Services revenue was a highlight, with record revenue over the first quarter, according to its latest earnings. That is expected to continue after installed devices hit a record of 2.2 billion in Q1.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other highlight could be an announcement of AI-related tools at the company&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference 2024, scheduled for 10 June. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is developing a handheld AI tool similar to ChatGPT and other competitors. These developments could boost the company&#8217;s stock in the year&#8217;s second half. However, it must hold the looming support level or risk being dragged lower to as low as $150.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s<span style="font-weight: 400;"> stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has continued downward since the US Department of Justice announced an antitrust action against it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31501" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="715" height="589" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png 715w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x247.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAPL was lower at $170.85 after news of the lawsuit and looks on course to test the $165.70 support from 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US DOJ and 16 state attorneys general are suing Apple for violating antitrust laws, which caused the stock’s value to drop by $115 billion in a day last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg said, “The US lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, according to the DOJ.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Union recently fined Apple $2 billion for preventing Spotify and other music streaming services from being removed from its platforms. That also included changes to Apple’s operating systems and platforms, including allowing third-party app stores and making Apple provide support for external third-party payment platforms.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the DOJ antitrust lawsuit could be more expensive and have more significant repercussions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers would benefit from a more open ecosystem, allowing users more choices, including access to alternative app stores and apps outside Apple’s selection. On the downside, it could make Apple’s user experience less secure with the threat of malware from third-party apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives is bullish on Apple stock. He currently has an Outperform rating and a $250 target price, which would be a 46% gain. However, he also sees the risk of Apple’s “core business model.”   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The key part of the DOJ case will likely argue that Apple unfairly penalises competitors and tech rivals by blocking other tech players from accessing hardware and software features of its flagship iPhone,” Ives wrote in a note to clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ives also believes that Apple will ultimately have to settle, which could see a hefty fine above $2 billion and some changes to the App Store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stock under pressure, support from the 2023 levels, at around $165.70, will likely be the following path forward.</span></p>
