<figure id="attachment_48895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48895" style="width: 802px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48895" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURUSD-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="EURUSD – Weekly Chart" width="802" height="516" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURUSD-–-Weekly-Chart.png 802w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURUSD-–-Weekly-Chart-300x193.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURUSD-–-Weekly-Chart-768x494.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48895" class="wp-caption-text">EURUSD – Weekly Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EURUSD rally has stalled at 1.15 and the 1.12 level is key support. A failure at that level could create a deeper correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eur v usd will be in focus for the rest of the week as Eurozone retail sales at 5pm HKT are followed by the latest Fed interest rate move ahead of Thursday’s session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US central bank is likely to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, despite heavy criticism from President Donald Trump to reduce borrowing costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The President caused a sharp drop in financial markets two weeks ago by saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but he backed away from that claim. His Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also supported a Fed rate cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US policymakers argue that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain previous price increases. The Fed ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as post-lockdown pressures led to higher inflation. Turmoil in supply chains was worsened by the Ukraine and Russia conflict. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite those pressures receding, the Fed is expected to leave its key rate unchanged at 4.3% when it meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. Powell and many of the 18 officials that make up the Fed’s rate-setting committee have commented that they want to see how Trump’s tariffs affect the economy before making any moves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump made further comments on Friday, saying on social media there is “NO INFLATION” and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, while fuel prices have also fallen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Mellon, said that the Fed is “scarred” by what happened in 2021, when prices rose due to supply issues and Fed officials said the increase would likely be “transitory.” Instead, inflation soared to a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and Trump’s new administration has referred to the Fed as “Team Transitory”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a Fed that is going to have to wait for evidence and be slow to adjust on that evidence,” Reinhart said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You could imagine a world where there isn’t pressure from the Trump administration and they cut rates&#8230;sooner, because they feel comfortable making the argument that they’re doing so because of the data,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders will follow Powell’s comments closely and the EURUSD will have its trend set out by the decision. Stubbornness to cut rates could see a drop in the pair.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48705" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURUSD - Daily Chart" width="799" height="573" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-Daily-Chart.png 799w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-Daily-Chart-300x215.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-Daily-Chart-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">EURUSD &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1.12 level is still key support for the EUR v USD going forward. The resistance comes in ahead of 1.16. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair has data beginning at 2pm HKT in the form of German retail sales. Germany&#8217;s consumer confidence has improved for a second month in April, but sentiment remains muted due to the current economic headwinds. The recent GfK Consumer Climate survey showed a rise of 3.7 points to -20.6 for May 2025, but still in negative territory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The realignment of the US administration’s trade policy has not yet left a sustained mark on German consumers&#8217; mood,&#8221; said Rolf Bürkl, consumer expert at NIM. &#8220;Instead, the swift resolution of political deadlock at home seems to have reduced a key driver of uncertainty, softening households’ precautionary savings behaviour.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An improvement in retail sales in the region’s largest economy could boost the euro ahead of the growth data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eurozone GDP growth figures are released at 5pm HKT with economists expecting a 0.2% growth reading like last month. However, a year-on-year dip to 1% annual growth is expected. Evening data for the United States is the ADP employment change number at 8:15pm HKT. The ADP figure is used as a barometer for the main </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/financial-events/non-farm-payroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non farm payrolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> number on Friday. Job openings in the United States fell during March as President Donald Trump took the axe to the public sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, down from 7.5 million in February, according to the Labor Department. With that collection of data, the EURUSD exchange rate will turn to the US GDP growth figures on Thursday evening and the NFP on Friday. Traders will look for any clue on the next path for interest rates from the European and US central banks.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_48322" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48322" style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48322" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-2.png" alt="EURUSD – Daily Chart" width="922" height="517" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-2.png 922w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-2-300x168.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-2-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48322" class="wp-caption-text">EURUSD – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURUSD is elevated above the highs from September-October with risk of a correction. 1.1225 is the support level now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European economy will have data at 3pm HKT in the form of services and manufacturing PMI for Germany and the Eurozone. Manufacturing data is still a drag on the composite figure which is expected to come in at 50.4 for Germany. A reading of 50.3 is expected for the eurozone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more positive figure may be ignored with a potential tariff-led hit in the weeks ahead. The US will release its own PMI data overnight at 9:45pm HKT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Central Bank cut interest rates recently for the seventh time to counter worries about economic growth. ECB President Christine Lagarde said “the major escalation in global trade tensions and the associated uncertainty will likely lower euro area growth by dampening exports. &#8220;And it may drag down investment and consumption”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation has fallen with the rate cuts but economic growth is still a worry, with the 20 countries that use the euro growing only 0.2% in the last quarter of 2024. Inflation was still 2.2% in March, close to the bank’s target of 2%. The ECB said in its March 6 meeting that they will pause after recent rate cuts. But that was not possible after the US tariff plans raised questions over growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US has been sold off since the tariffs began and recent talk of trade deals and a de-escalation with China could reverse the trend and see the EURUSD undergoing a technical correction. In the short-term, the PMI figures will be the guide.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47691" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="EURUSD – Daily Chart" width="940" height="564" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 940w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURUSD spiked to 1.110 but has since pulled back. There is resistance higher at the 1.2029 level but there is potential for a retreat to the support at 1.075 first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar has regained some ground as traders see less positives for the European economies in a trade war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ECB policy maker Luis De Guindos noted that a </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trade war</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would mostly impact economic growth. He added that the disinflation process was continuing and the ECB’s 2% target should be achieved in the coming months. The impact of trade on inflation should be offset over the medium term by lower economic growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders are selling the euro due to the fears of slower economic growth and the belief that the ECB will cut rates again. The market is currently pricing an 80% chance that ECB would cut its key rate in April. The market is also looking at a total of 60bps of additional cuts over the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downturn in French manufacturing eased in March, according to a recent survey, although the outlook for the sector remains weak due to weak orders. At 48.5, the index is still in contraction mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;France&#8217;s industry is failing to break out of recession. Despite a significant improvement in the HCOB PMI for manufacturing in March, the situation remains sobering,&#8221; said Hamburg Commercial economist Tariq Kamal Chaudhry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The French President has urged companies to halt all US investment until the tariff situation is clarified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Investments to come or investments announced in recent weeks should be suspended until things are clarified with the United States,” Macron said last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currency market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could remain volatile as currency flows impact the current exchange rate picture.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest surge in the euro drove the price above the 1.10 level and bulls now target the 1.20 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The currency market may be quiet on Friday as traders await the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/financial-events/non-farm-payroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US non-farm payrolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> job report. There is a chance that it can also add to euro gains after the DOGE-related job terminations of US federal workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layoffs announced by employers in the US surged in March to their highest level since the pandemic as the government purged federal workers and contractors to cut spending. Global outplacement company Challenger said on Thursday that planned job cuts increased 60% to 275,000 last month, the highest level since May 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 497,000 layoffs were announced in the first three months of the year, the highest since the first quarter of 2009, when the economy was at the end of the pandemic recession. More than half of the job cuts were in Washington D.C., highlighting the federal job cut effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the technical side, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator surged to 72 in the EURUSD which hints at overbought conditions. That can also offer the potential for a final leg higher as bears back away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar struggled against most other major currencies, particularly the Japanese yen, the euro, the British pound, and the Swiss franc, after Donald Trump announced a minimum 10% </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/market-news/us-stocks-fall-trump-liberation-day-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tariff on imports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Traders now expect an economic backlash against the United States. Despite this, the euro rally may be slightly misguided as Europe will see its own economic fallout. For example, the tariffs on the EU will cover 25% of Ireland’s American exports and could result in multibillion-euro losses in trade in the short term, according to a major Irish business group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a big opportunity for currency traders as the tariff situation could see extended moves and volatility over the coming months as tariffs feed into economic indicators.</span></p>

The pair fell below 1.0750 for the first time since early March as trade concerns continued to weigh on </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/learn-the-role-of-trading-market-sentiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market sentiment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US President Donald Trump reaffirmed plans to implement broad tariffs in April, adding to uncertainty. In response, the European Union indicated it is preparing its own set of countermeasures against potential US trade actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With risk sentiment weakening, EUR/USD remains under pressure and may face further declines as April 2 approaches.</span></p>
<h3><b>President Trump Plans 25% Tariff on Imported Vehicles</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration is moving forward with a broad tariff on all copper imports into the US, aligning with its recent 25% flat import tax on steel and aluminum. In addition, President Trump is expected to introduce new tariffs on automobiles. European Union (EU) officials anticipate that the US may impose a tariff of approximately 20% on a range of goods, though the specifics remain uncertain.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fed’s Musalem Expects Inflation to Return to 2% by 2027</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tariffs may be part of a broader “reciprocal” trade policy set to take effect on April 2. It remains unclear whether certain countries will receive exemptions. The proposed measures aim to match tariffs imposed by other nations on US goods, introducing a new layer of complexity to international trade policies. Additionally, President Trump has suggested that VAT and luxury taxes could be considered indirect tariffs on US exports and may be included in the reciprocal tariff structure.</span></p>
<h3><b>US Economic Data Outlook</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US GDP growth figures are set for release on Thursday, though the final print is not expected to generate significant market movement. The key focus this week will be the Core Personal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumption Expenditure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PCE) Price Index, scheduled for Friday. Investors are watching closely to see if the recent rise in inflation is temporary, but forecasts indicate that annualized PCE inflation may increase to 2.7% year-over-year in February.</span></p>
<h2><b>EUR/USD Price Forecast</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EUR/USD continues to decline, with six consecutive days of losses pushing the pair nearly 2% lower from last week’s peak above 1.0950. Bearish momentum remains strong, and the pair is approaching the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), located just below the 1.0700 level.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46422" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURUSD – Daily Chart" width="882" height="508" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 882w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x173.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the EURUSD has surged above the 1.06 level after setting a base ahead of 1.02. The next target on the weekly level is at 1.12. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European retail sales will arrive at 6pm HKT today with markets expecting 1.9% growth. That will lead into US jobless claims data overnight and a press conference from the European central bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volume can be expected again after the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/financial-events/non-farm-payroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US non-farm payrolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data where analysts expect to see a reading of 160k up from 143k last month. The number will be the first test of Donald Trump’s Federal jobs cuts as they filter across the next couple of releases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reduction in jobs and the new tariffs on the likes of Canada and Mexico have led to money leaving the United States over recession fears. Trump has talked of concessions and reduced tariffs but some short-covering has hit the euro and could add to recent gains if the data is suitable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar also weakened after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that they are seeking to bring interest rates &#8220;down,&#8221; according to Reuters. His comments hurt the US dollar and traders have raised Federal Reserve dovish bets after some weaker economic data from the US. The expectation for the Fed to reduce interest rates in June has increased to 87% from 69% a week ago, according to CME FedWatch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ECB President Christine Lagarde is expected to communicate clearly where rates will go for the rest of the year, with the central bank set to cut rates again late on Thursday. Another move would mark six cuts and take rates down to 2.5% in the eurozone.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the EUR v USD has found resistance at 1.06 and at the 2023 lows near 1.045. The path ahead may now be clear to 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe is a region that is more vulnerable to US President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to increase tariffs on the country’s imports. The US is a big buyer of EU exports, such as cars, chemicals and luxury goods.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe’s economy has been struggling with recession in Germany and growth near zero in other countries. That has piled pressure on the single currency and is close to costing the job of Germany’s Chancellor and France’s President. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Euro weakness has aligned with strength for the US dollar globally. Demand has grown on expectations of economic strength under Donald Trump. Investors are hoping that the incoming President can resolve the country’s spending problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the election, at least 10 large banks are expecting a weaker euro, with some even predicting a move below the 1 threshold in 2025. The expectation for parity is not unanimous as some analysts believe the speed at which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s policy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposals might be implemented may be slower. The country faces an important speaker vote on Friday and there has been some infighting among Republicans over spending cuts planned under Trump.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43951" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/EURUSD-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="EURUSD - Weekly Chart" width="876" height="594" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/EURUSD-Weekly-Chart.png 876w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/EURUSD-Weekly-Chart-300x203.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/EURUSD-Weekly-Chart-768x521.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURUSD &#8211; Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EURUSD is poised above support on the weekly chart but a strong rebound is needed to avoid a potential downturn to much lower levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macron named Francois Bayrou as his new PM to run his government on Friday after his previous choice for the role served the shortest term in modern French history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macron appointed Bayrou after Michael Barnier was thrown out last week in a no-confidence vote in France&#8217;s National Assembly. The move was forced after parties clashed over the proposed budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors will be curious about what can change with the troubled budget and the euro may remain under pressure. Bayrou is now Macron&#8217;s fourth prime minister in a year as the nation faces turmoil.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">French voters have been unhappy at measures, such as raising the retirement age and rival parties wanted to see more support for struggling families in areas such as energy prices. The opposition leader Marine Le Pen urged him to &#8220;do what his predecessor didn&#8217;t want to do&#8221; and pass a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any other approach would only be a continuation of Macronism, twice rejected at the ballot box, could only lead to impasse and failure,” she posted on X. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France now has a budget deficit of about 6% of GDP, which is over twice the limit permitted by European Union spending rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday brings a speech from Christine Lagarde, ECB President, at 3pm HKT. That will be followed by French and German data with services and manufacturing at around 4:15 pm and 4:30pm. The same data will be released for the United States overnight ahead of the Tuesday session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nato’s leader has said that European governments should return to a “war mindset” and divert money from health and other areas to defense. That will be hard as the region remains strapped for cash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US incoming President Donald Trump has talked about a series of drone sightings in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mystery sightings all over the country. Can this really be happening without our government&#8217;s knowledge? I don&#8217;t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!,&#8221; Trump wrote on his social media platform.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EUR/USD Market Outlook</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/eur-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EUR/USD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pair experienced a slight decline on Monday, retreating from the 1.06 level following a technical rejection last week. Euro traders are awaiting Thursday&#8217;s European Central Bank (ECB) rate call, while Greenback bidders anticipate the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation updates on Wednesday.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">ECB Rate Cut Concerns and US Consumer Expectations</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pan-EU Sentix Investor Confidence survey for December fell to a 13-month low of -17.5, adding to the concerns of Euro bulls. The ECB is expected to reduce both its Main Refinancing Operations Rate and Rate on Deposit Facility by 25 bps each on Thursday. Meanwhile, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey revealed that US consumers have improved financial expectations, but also raised their expectations for future inflation, with the average respondent expecting inflation to reaccelerate to 3% by next November.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">US CPI Inflation and EUR/USD Price Forecast</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US session traders will be looking ahead to a fresh print of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation slated for Wednesday, with a thin docket on the offering for the early week. Median market forecasts expect Wednesday’s US CPI inflation to rise to 2.7% YoY compared to October’s 2.6%.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43804" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-638693858756656601.webp" alt="EUR/USD Daily chart" width="1723" height="835" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-638693858756656601.webp 1723w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-638693858756656601-300x145.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-638693858756656601-1024x496.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-638693858756656601-768x372.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-638693858756656601-1536x744.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1723px) 100vw, 1723px" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EUR/USD Daily chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR/USD daily chart shows a bearish medium-term trend as the pair remains below its 50-day EMA at 1.0703 and 200-day EMA at 1.0828. The pair has entered a consolidation phase after the sharp drop in mid-November. Resistance at 1.06–1.0650 and support at 1.0450 are key levels to watch. The MACD indicator has started to turn slightly positive, suggesting that bearish momentum is fading. However, the overall trend has yet to shift convincingly. A breakout above 1.06 with increasing bullish momentum would be critical for buyers, while failure to do so keeps the pair vulnerable to further downside, aligning with the broader bearish trend.</span></p>
