										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">German stock market (GER 30)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has continued its strong recovery and has hit new highs. However, some slowing momentum in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/mt4-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MACD indicator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a warning. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50542" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50542" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GER 30 – Daily Chart" width="640" height="651" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart.png 640w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart-295x300.png 295w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50542" class="wp-caption-text">GER 30 – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the GER 30 now trades at 24,040 after a slump to as low as 19,000 in April. The push to new highs has occurred alongside a declining MACD indicator which would raise caution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The German stock market continues to move strongly despite a weak economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent data showed German wage growth has eased significantly, and economic weakness suggests future bonuses will likely be much lower than in the past, according to the Bundesbank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-quarter negotiated wages rose just 0.9% from a year ago, compared to a 5.8% gain at the end of 2024, according to the central bank’s report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany’s economy is expected to stagnate this year as the country faces headwinds from  Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade threats, the government’s panel of economic advisers said Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany has Europe’s largest economy, but hasn’t seen significant economic growth in five years, and gross domestic product shrank in each of the last two years. The panel, in its first forecast since new Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office earlier this month, predicted the economy will stagnate before 1% growth in 2026. A previous forecast in November predicted 0.4% growth this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new outlook is similar to the forecast made a month ago by Germany’s former government. Merz, who took office on May 6, has announced plans to cut bureaucracy, advance digitization, provide tax breaks for companies and promote more free trade agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump’s tariff policy is increasing uncertainty and endangering economic growth worldwide,” said Monika Schnitzer, the head of the panel. But she added that a huge investment package offered by Merz’s coalition “offers opportunities for a modernization of infrastructure in Germany and a return to a higher path of growth”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders can still find some dip buying momentum in the GER 30 but should be wary of any change in sentiment from news headlines that could create another pullback.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_49025" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49025" style="width: 754px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-49025" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER30-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GER30 - Daily Chart" width="754" height="462" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER30-Daily-Chart.png 754w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER30-Daily-Chart-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49025" class="wp-caption-text">GER30 &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some mild selling created a barrier at the previous highs but there is still room to rally through that level and aim to create further upside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friedrich Merz’s failure to secure a Bundestag majority sent shockwaves through German markets on Tuesday, raising questions about the country&#8217;s political stability as economic clouds darken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;His setback adds fresh uncertainty to Germany’s export-driven economy, which is already under pressure from shifting US trade policies,&#8221; said Welt&#8217;s Holger Zschäpitz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Germany voted for change. Politicians decided to keep everything unchanged. Now, the coalition of industry and economic destruction cannot even agree to vote for a chancellor,” said Daniel Lacalle, chief economist at Tressis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merz, the leader of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, believed he had secured a post-election coalition agreement with the Social Democrats. But with a stunning reversal, he received just 310 of the 316 votes needed to officially become chancellor. It is the first time in postwar Germany that a presumptive chancellor has failed to gain parliamentary approval after such a deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a second vote, Merz did get the required approval but it raises questions about the ability to push through reforms. Investors will focus on Merz’s plans to revive Germany’s flagging economy. Despite economic weakness, stocks remain elevated and will need to see positive data to hold onto the current gains.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_48543" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48543" style="width: 826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48543" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="GER 30 – Daily Chart" width="826" height="529" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 826w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x192.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x492.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48543" class="wp-caption-text">GER 30 – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GER 30 index has rallied strongly from 18,899 to 22,224 and can push ahead to previous resistance at the 23,000 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">German shares have been boosted by the recent walkback of US tariffs and some investors are seeing the opportunity to diversify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been on a tough downturn since the beginning of the year, indicating that the markets are viewing Trump&#8217;s policies as a net-negative for US equities. That has brought more investors to German and European stocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares in Germany are rallying despite the government downgrading its growth forecasts for the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IMF was also negative about the prospects for the German economy. The group predicted zero growth for the German economy in 2025 due to tariff uncertainty. In its latest forecast, the Washington-based organization said Europe&#8217;s largest economy will stagnate this year, revising down a January forecast of 0.3% growth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany&#8217;s export-based economy is set to be hit particularly hard in a global slowdown, with the IMF forecast of 0% growth in gross domestic product (GDP) placing the country at the bottom of the Group of 7 industrialized nations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these figures, investors seem happy to add capital into German shares and it highlights a speculative nature. Traders should be seeing these swings as an opportunity to trade the volatility, alongside currency changes as markets are not trading versus economic growth prospects.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European stocks suffered their largest drop since August as traders fear export tariffs.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-47554 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GER 30 – Daily Chart" width="759" height="582" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart.png 759w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GER 30 – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">German blue chip stock index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slumped to 21,703 as the bullish rally began to collapse. The next support is at 21,250 and 20,500 levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European banks led the rally this year, and they were among the hardest-hit sectors, falling 5.5%. Automakers were also hurt, extending their year-to-date losses to -7.2%, after </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/market-news/us-stocks-fall-trump-liberation-day-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s tariffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on auto imports took effect after midnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France and Germany are now pushing for a more aggressive tariff response that could strengthen the EU’s negotiating stance. The huge escalation in Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/us-trade-war-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trade war</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> threatens to wipe out a big part of the euro-area expansion that the European Central Bank forecasts for this year and next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The question is how fast this translates into hard economic data,” said Kevin Thozet at Carmignac in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bond markets and safe havens, such as utilities and real estate rose as investors cut risk and moved money into defensive shares. Investors are now focusing on income in these times of uncertainty as they wait to see how countries hit back with their own countermeasures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tariff worries have shaken the positive mood that had boosted European stocks this year as they focused on increased government spending in Germany, and lower interest rates. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index had outpaced the S&amp;P 500 by a record of almost 15 percentage points in the first quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European economic situation did not really warrant record highs in the stock market and late-stage bulls are now paying the price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The announcement was close to being the worst-case scenario for markets,” said Wolf von Rotberg, equity strategist at Bank J. Safra Sarasin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The size of reciprocal tariffs and their immediacy will put substantial strains on trade globally. A global economic slowdown seems almost inevitable, which the US won’t be spared from. As European and global equity markets have not been priced for such a scenario, they will likely have to adjust further to the downside”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are cautious as some sectors such as pharmaceuticals, timber, and semiconductors still have tariffs pending. Until the situation is cleared up and investors see the initial economic data then we may still see the trend continue with bonds and defensive stocks outperforming in Europe.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">GER 30 – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/indices-trading">GER 30 index</a> rallied to the March highs at 23,493, and the price has now slipped to the 22,957 level. There is a chance of a correction in the short term, with support starting at 22,400.</p>
<p>Germany’s historic shift in lifting its debt brake is expected to reshape Europe’s economy with a wave of public spending that could boost growth across the eurozone.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs analysts have singled out 12 buy-rated European companies with the defence sector that could benefit from the spending boom in industries such as airport operations and renewable energy.</p>
<p>The German coalition set out a €500 billion infrastructure fund, equivalent to 11.6% of GDP in 2024, to be released over the next ten years. This fund aims to revamp the country’s infrastructure, boost the energy transition and add investment to housing and transport.</p>
<p>The new German leader has broken from the country’s strict rules on spending to exempt military spending from the constitutional debt rules. That can add up to €11 billion per year in additional military upgrades.</p>
<p>“There has been a material repricing of reflation risk in Europe versus the U.S. across assets,” said Christian Mueller-Glissmann, CFA, at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Goldman said that the chemical firm BASF could see cash flow improve as it brought a €10 billion investment in China online. E.ON can benefit from spending on electrical grids and Siemens Energy can be boosted from a move to gas power plants, which make up 31% of the group’s revenue.</p>
<p>Wind turbine manufacturers and logistics companies could also benefit from the fiscal shift. Germany’s stock market has been surging despite the struggling economy, and government spending will be watched closely.</p>
