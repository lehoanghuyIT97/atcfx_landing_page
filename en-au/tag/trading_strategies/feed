<h2 id="what-is-a-candlestick-pattern" dir="ltr">What is a Candlestick Pattern</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">A candlestick pattern is a strategy based on technical analysis that leverages historical price movements on charts to predict future price changes. Originating from techniques used by Japanese rice traders, these patterns have been trusted for decades to forecast market behaviour. They consist of one or more candlesticks, indicating whether the market will continue in the same direction, reverse, or remain stable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Traders should familiarise themselves with various types of candlestick pattern or candlestick chart pattern and understand their potential impact on trading decisions in <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial markets</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="how-are-candlesticks-formed-and-how-to-read-them" dir="ltr">How Are Candlesticks Formed and How To Read Them?</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Each candlestick on a chart represents the price movements of various financial assets, including <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currencies</a>, <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETFs</a>, <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stocks</a>, <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indices</a>, and <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commodities</a>, over a specified time frame, which can range from minutes to weeks based on the trader&#8217;s preferences. Candlesticks are formed from the price movements of financial instruments, detailing the opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices for the selected period, such as 1 minute, 5 minutes, a day, a month, or a year. When traders mention &#8220;candlesticks&#8221; without additional context, they typically refer to traditional candlestick charts that emphasise these price movements. A candlestick comprises four key points: the open, high, low, and close of a trading session, providing a clear depiction of an asset&#8217;s price fluctuations over that period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each candlestick consists of a body and wicks. The body indicates the opening and closing prices, while the wicks represent the highest and lowest values reached during that time. Although trading volume is not part of the candlestick itself, it is often used alongside candlestick chart patterns to gain further insights into the strength and significance of price movements. CandleVolume charts, a specific type of candlestick chart, incorporate trading volume directly into the candlestick&#8217;s visual representation. Thus, interpreting a candlestick chart is a crucial skill for traders, as it provides valuable information about market sentiment and potential future price movements. When the closing price is higher than the opening price, the candlestick body is green, indicating a price increase. Conversely, if the closing price is lower than the opening price, the body is red, indicating a price decrease. Colours may vary by platform, but red and green are commonly used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The vertical lines, or &#8220;wicks,&#8221; extending from the top and bottom of the body illustrate the highest and lowest prices during the trading session. Traders use candlestick patterns or candlestick chart patterns to identify market trends and cycles, which inform their trading strategies.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="bullish-candlestick-patterns" dir="ltr">Bullish Candlestick Patterns</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Bullish candlestick patterns suggest a potential rise in buying interest, indicating that the price is likely to increase. These patterns typically appear during or after a decline, signalling a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish candlestick pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="1" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Bullish Engulfing</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Bullish engulfing occurs when a giant green candle engulfs the smaller red candle from the previous session. It shows buyers have swamped sellers and may continue to drive prices upward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This candlestick pattern is a strong bullish indication, particularly when it emerges following a long decline or around a support level. It shows a significant shift of momentum from sellers to buyers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36463" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2-Bullish-Engulfing-1-1024x529.webp" alt="Bullish Engulfing" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2-Bullish-Engulfing-1-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2-Bullish-Engulfing-1-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2-Bullish-Engulfing-1-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2-Bullish-Engulfing-1.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="2" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Hammer</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The hammer is identified by a small body at the upper range with a long lower wick and little or no upper wick. It occurs during a decline, indicating a possible reversal or support level. It signifies that despite selling pressure, buyers managed to close the session near the opening level, showing strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commonly viewed as a beacon of hope in a bearish market, the Hammer suggests that the market may be finding a bottom, with buyers starting to outnumber sellers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-36316 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-Hammer-1024x529.webp" alt="Hammer" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-Hammer-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-Hammer-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-Hammer-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-Hammer.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="3" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Morning Star</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This three-candle pattern begins with a large red candle, followed by a small-bodied candle that gaps down and concludes with a large green candle that fits within the body of the first candle. This sequence indicates a shift in sentiment from bearish candlestick to bullish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This pattern is particularly significant when the third candle erases the losses of the first candle, showing intense buying pressure and a potential change in market direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-36317 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4-Morning-Star-1024x529.webp" alt="Morning Star" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4-Morning-Star-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4-Morning-Star-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4-Morning-Star-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4-Morning-Star.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="4" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Three White Soldiers</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Three white soldiers consist of three consecutive long green candles with small wicks, each session opens within the previous candle&#8217;s body and closes at a new high. This pattern indicates growing buying momentum and is seen as strongly bullish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This pattern typically confirms a shift in momentum from bearish to bullish candlestick pattern. It is considered reliable when each candlestick opens progressively higher, indicating sustained buying pressure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-36318 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/5-Three-White-Soldiers-1024x529.webp" alt="Three White Soldiers" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/5-Three-White-Soldiers-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/5-Three-White-Soldiers-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/5-Three-White-Soldiers-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/5-Three-White-Soldiers.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="5" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Piercing Line</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This pattern consists of two candles in a downtrend: the first is a long red candle, and the second is a long green candle that starts at a new low but closes above the midpoint of the first candle. It suggests a potential bullish reversal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reversal implication of the Piercing Line is more potent if the second candle&#8217;s close is well into the first candle&#8217;s actual body. This shows a convincing comeback by the bulls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-36319 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/6-Piercing-Line-1024x529.webp" alt="Piercing Line" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/6-Piercing-Line-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/6-Piercing-Line-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/6-Piercing-Line-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/6-Piercing-Line.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="6" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Bullish Harami</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The Bullish Harami appears during a downtrend, where a large red candle is followed by a smaller green candle that is entirely contained within the vertical range of the previous red candle&#8217;s body. This formation indicates a potential reversal or a slowdown in bearish momentum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This setup often suggests a pause in bearish momentum, with the potential for a bullish reversal if it is followed by higher closing prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36464" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-Bullish-Harami-1-1024x529.webp" alt="Bullish Harami" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-Bullish-Harami-1-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-Bullish-Harami-1-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-Bullish-Harami-1-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-Bullish-Harami-1.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="7" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Rising Three Methods</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The Rising Methods pattern begins with a long green candle, followed by three small-bodied candles that remain within the range of the first green candle and concludes with another long green candle. This pattern suggests the continuation of the current upward trend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It indicates a &#8220;resting&#8221; phase in the market, with the bulls regaining dominance toward the end, signalling that the uptrend is likely to continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36324" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/8-Rising-Three-Methods-1024x529.webp" alt="Rising Three Methods" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/8-Rising-Three-Methods-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/8-Rising-Three-Methods-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/8-Rising-Three-Methods-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/8-Rising-Three-Methods.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="8" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Tweezer Bottoms</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Tweezer bottoms feature two consecutive candles with almost identical lows. It typically appears during a downtrend, suggesting a bullish reversal is imminent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This pattern signifies a strong rejection of lower prices and can serve as an early indication of a bullish reversal, particularly following an extended downtrend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36328" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9-Tweezer-Bottom-1024x529.webp" alt="Tweezer Bottom" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9-Tweezer-Bottom-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9-Tweezer-Bottom-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9-Tweezer-Bottom-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9-Tweezer-Bottom.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<ol class="no-markers" start="9" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Doji</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">A Doji forms when a financial instrument&#8217;s opening and closing prices are virtually equal, resulting in a tiny body. The wicks can vary in length. This pattern indicates indecision in the market and can signal a potential reversal or continuation depending on the context in which it appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Doji patterns are particularly significant when found at the top or bottom of trends, suggesting potential reversal points as market sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish or vice versa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36329" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/10-Doji-1024x529.webp" alt="Doji" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/10-Doji-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/10-Doji-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/10-Doji-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/10-Doji.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Three Inside Up</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The Three Inside Up pattern starts with a large red candle, followed by a smaller green candle that closes within the body of the first candle. The third green candle closes above the peak of the first candle, confirming the pattern and indicating a potential reversal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36330" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11-Three-Inside-Up-1024x529.webp" alt="Three Inside Up" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11-Three-Inside-Up-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11-Three-Inside-Up-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11-Three-Inside-Up-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11-Three-Inside-Up.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<ol class="no-markers" start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="bearish-candlestick-patterns" dir="ltr">Bearish Candlestick Patterns</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Bearish candlestick patterns indicate an increase in selling pressure, suggesting that prices may decline. These patterns often appear during or after an uptrend, signalling a shift from bullish to bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="1" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Bearish Engulfing</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The Bearish Engulfing pattern forms when a large red candle (indicating a price decrease) completely engulfs the smaller green candle (indicating a price increase) from the previous day. This pattern suggests that sellers have overtaken buyers, potentially leading to further price declines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36331" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/12-Bearish-Engulfing-1024x529.webp" alt="Bearish Engulfing" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/12-Bearish-Engulfing-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/12-Bearish-Engulfing-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/12-Bearish-Engulfing-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/12-Bearish-Engulfing.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="2" type="I">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Shooting Star</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The Shooting Star emerges following an upswing. It features a small body at the lower end of the trading range, a long upper wick, and little or no lower wick. It indicates that buyers attempted to push the price higher but were overwhelmed by sellers, driving the price back down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The effectiveness of the Shooting Star pattern increases if the next candle closes below the Shooting Star&#8217;s close, confirming the bearish reversal.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Evening Star</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This three-candle pattern begins with a huge green candle, then a small-bodied candle that sits above the first. It culminates with a big red candle that closes within the body of the first candle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This setup is a strong reversal pattern, especially when the third candle significantly erodes the gains of the first candle, indicating a surge in selling pressure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36333" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/14-Evening-Star-1024x529.webp" alt="Evening Star" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/14-Evening-Star-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/14-Evening-Star-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/14-Evening-Star-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/14-Evening-Star.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Hanging Man</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This pattern resembles the hammer but occurs at the end of an uptrend. It features a small body with a long lower wick and indicates that selling pressure is starting to exceed buying pressure, warning of a potential reversal or significant decline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reliability of this pattern as a bearish signal increases if it is followed by a downward continuation, confirming that bears are in control.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Three Black Crows</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This pattern consists of three subsequent long red candles with short wicks, with each session closing at a lower position than the previous one. It indicates a significant downturn and bearish sentiments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This pattern is a stark indication of bearish dominance, often prompting traders to exit long positions and potentially triggering a broader sell-off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Dark Cloud Cover</h3>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">This two-candle pattern starts with a long green candle, followed by a long red candle that opens higher but closes below the midpoint of the previous candle. This pattern strongly indicates a bearish reversal, particularly if the next candlestick shows further downward movement.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Bearish Harami</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">At the conclusion of an uptrend, this pattern unfolds with a large green candle succeeded by a smaller red candle entirely encompassed within the vertical range of the preceding body. It potentially signifies a decrease in bullish momentum and might foreshadow a bearish reversal, particularly if subsequent closes are lower.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Falling Three Methods</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The falling three methods begin with a long red candle, then three small-bodied candles within the range, and end with another large red candle.

<p dir="ltr">Tweezer tops are defined by two subsequent candles that have almost similar highs. It often emerges following an upswing, signalling that a decline is about to begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This pattern clearly indicates a probable shift from bullish to bearish sentiment, primarily if it is supported by further bearish signs or dropping volume on the subsequent candles.</p>

<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-candlestick-patterns" dir="ltr">Pros and Cons of Candlestick Patterns</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Candlestick patterns are widely used in technical analysis to forecast future price changes by examining historical market behaviour. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these patterns is crucial for effectively incorporating them into a comprehensive trading strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Pros</h3>
<h4 dir="ltr">Visual Clarity</h4>
<p dir="ltr">A significant feature of candlestick charts is their ability to transmit complex pricing data in a simple visual format. Traders may quickly understand market sentiment, price movements, and volatility by studying candlesticks and their patterns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Immediate Insights</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Candlestick patterns provide quick insights into the market&#8217;s psychological state, helping traders determine whether buyers or sellers dominate the price movement. This is necessary for making rapid trading decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Enhanced Trading Strategies</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Traders often use candlestick patterns in conjunction with other technical analysis tools such as moving averages, RSI, and MACD to validate trade signals. This combination can enhance trading strategies and decision-making processes, leading to improved outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Predictive Power</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Candlestick patterns are commonly employed to predict future market reversals or continuations. Patterns like the Bullish Engulfing and Bearish Harami can anticipate significant shifts in market trends, allowing traders to capitalise on potential upcoming movements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/trading-accounts/demo-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25028" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/demo-account-1024x256.webp" alt="demo account" width="1200" height="300" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/demo-account-1024x256.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/demo-account-300x75.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/demo-account-768x192.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/demo-account.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Cons</h3>
<h4 dir="ltr">Subjectivity</h4>
<p dir="ltr">A notable challenge with candlestick patterns is their inherent subjectivity. Various traders may interpret the same patterns differently, and there can be ambiguity regarding what precisely defines a specific pattern. This variability can result in inconsistent trading decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">False Signals</h4>
<p dir="ltr">However, candlestick patterns, like all technical indicators, can produce false signals. Market behaviour may deviate from the expected outcomes of these patterns due to unforeseen factors such as economic news, changes in market sentiment, or external events, potentially leading to trader losses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Requires Experience</h4>
<p dir="ltr">A trader needs a good amount of experience and knowledge to use candlestick patterns effectively. Without substantial practice, beginners might find it challenging to identify and act on the patterns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Overreliance Risk</h4>
<p dir="ltr">There is a risk of traders excessively relying on candlestick patterns while overlooking other critical elements of trading, such as fundamental analysis, market conditions, and news. This overdependence can result in inadequately informed trading decisions.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-deflation" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What is Deflation</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deflation refers to a lower overall cost of goods and services. When the inflation rate falls below 0%, depreciation increases the actual value of money over time. Depreciation may seem advantageous at first glance because it increases the currency&#8217;s purchasing power, but its effects may be profound. Because deflation enormously impacts everything from personal savings to worldwide economic stability, understanding it is crucial for economists, policymakers, and the general public.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deflation occurs when there&#8217;s a sustained drop in the price levels of goods and services, typically measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This economic phenomenon differs from temporary price declines because it is persistent and affects the economy broadly, not just specific sectors. The causes of deflation are usually rooted in a reduction in the supply of money or credit or due to decreased demand for goods and services, which can stem from various factors, including increased savings rates, reduced consumer confidence, or significant improvements in technology that lower production costs.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-33620" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-what-is-deflation.webp" alt="what-is-deflation" width="503" height="260" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-what-is-deflation.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-what-is-deflation-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-what-is-deflation-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-what-is-deflation-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" /></span></p>

<ol class="no-markers" start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="causes-of-deflation" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Causes of Deflation</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Various factors, mainly those related to shifts in supply and demand, may cause deflation. A decline in consumer spending is frequently brought on by increased financial uncertainty or savings rates, as well as an oversupply of goods. Furthermore, technological advancements can lower product prices and production costs, causing deflationary pressure. Depending on the financial environment, these elements can mix sophisticatedly.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Moreover, deflation can also be triggered by global economic trends, such as increased global competition or changes in trade policies that lower the price of imported goods. Additionally, governmental fiscal austerity measures, which involve reducing public spending and increasing taxes, can depress economic activity and lead to a decrease in consumer demand, further pushing prices downward. Another significant contributor to deflation can be a strong currency, which makes imported goods cheaper and domestic products less competitive abroad, thus exacerbating the decline in prices. Each of these factors can contribute to a sustained period of deflation, affecting everything from consumer behaviour to broader economic policies, often requiring coordinated international responses to address effectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="impacts-of-deflation" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Impacts of Deflation</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The effects of deflation are numerous. It primarily means lower prices for consumers. However, if depreciation persists, it may result in lower business profits, leading to lower income and employment. Consumer spending is reduced as a result, triggering a vicious cycle that can cause an economic downturn. Depreciation may increase the cost of repaying existing debt, which could increase default rates on a financial level.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Additionally, deflation can lead to a deferral of consumption and investment. As prices continue to fall, both consumers and businesses might postpone purchases in anticipation of even lower prices in the future. This delay in spending exacerbates the downturn as production slows, leading to further reductions in workforce and wages, which in turn diminish consumer spending power even more. Moreover, the uncertainty generated by falling prices can lead to decreased confidence and increased market volatility. Financial institutions may become more risk-averse, tightening credit conditions and further restricting the flow of money into the economy, which can stifle economic growth and innovation. This cycle of negative economic activity can be difficult to reverse without significant intervention from policymakers.</span></p>

<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-deflation" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2 Pros and 2 Cons of Deflation</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Pros</span></h3>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Increased Purchasing Power as Prices Decline</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deflation, despite its potential drawbacks, can also bring about positive changes. When the price drops overall during depreciation, consumers may find that they can spend more with the same amount of money. This increased purchasing power opens up opportunities to purchase items and services that were earlier beyond their financial reach, potentially improving their quality of life.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Lower Costs Can Lead to Increased Exports in a Globalized Economy</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deflation lowers prices for goods produced internally, allowing manufacturers to lower their production costs. This could increase a nation&#8217;s export competitiveness on the global stage, leading to higher export sales abroad and enhancing the trade balance.</span></p>

<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Businesses May Suffer from Lower Earnings, Leading to Job Cuts and Reduced Investment</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the most concerning aspects of deflation is its potential to trigger a downward spiral in the economy. As prices drop, businesses experience a decrease in income, leading to job losses and reduced investment in new projects and technologies. This, in turn, can push businesses to lower costs to maintain profitability, further exacerbating the cycle. These negative pressures can lead to slower economic growth and a prolonged economic downturn.</span></p>

<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Consumers and Businesses May Delay Purchases in Anticipation of Further Price Drops</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deflation has the contradictory effect of causing consumers to delay spending in anticipation that prices will drop even more despite having more purchasing power. This conduct, known as the negative spiral, further causes businesses to lower prices, perpetuating the cycle.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Businesses may delay investing in technology or capital goods upgrades in order to anticipate lower costs in the future. This sluggish purchase causes stagnation in technology and slows down economic development.</span></p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Great Depression of the 1930s</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Understanding the historical incidents of deflation, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s, is crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of this economic phenomenon. The Great Depression, which began with the stock market crash of 1929 and lasted throughout the 1930s, was marked by deflation. Prices and wages plummeted due to massive unemployment and a severe drop in consumer spending. During this deflationary period increased the real value of debt, making it harder for individuals and companies to pay off what they owed. This led to a cycle of reduced spending and increased savings, further deepening the economic downturn. By learning from these historical incidents, we can better prepare for and mitigate the effects of future deflationary periods.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">For example, between 1929 and 1933, the United States saw a 25% drop in prices, significantly increasing the burden of mortgages and loans and leading to widespread foreclosures and bankruptcies.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-33622" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4-unemployment-rate.webp" alt="unemployment-rate" width="823" height="425" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4-unemployment-rate.webp 1200w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4-unemployment-rate-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4-unemployment-rate-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4-unemployment-rate-768x397.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Japan’s &#8220;Lost Decade&#8221; in the 1990s</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Japan’s experience in the 1990s provides another significant example of how deflation can severely impact an economy. After the asset price bubble burst at the beginning of the decade, Japan faced a prolonged period of deflation that lasted well into the 2000s. This deflation was characterised by falling prices, which, while initially seeming beneficial, led to decreased business revenues and a reluctance to invest in a falling market. As a result, the economy stagnated, and recovery efforts were complicated by the deflationary mindset that discouraged spending and investment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">During this period, real estate and stock market prices fell drastically, and despite low-interest rates, economic growth remained sluggish due to reduced consumer spending and corporate investment.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Additional Considerations</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">These two historic incidents demonstrate how deflation may cause an economic contraction cycle. Consumers and businesses anticipating further price declines may experience psychological effects, which may worsen economic slowdowns by causing more extended periods of spending and investment. These instances further illustrate policymakers&#8217; difficulties in reducing deflation because current measures, such as lowering interest rates, do not suffice when rates are near zero. Businesses may wait to invest in technology or capital goods upgrades to anticipate lower costs in the future. This sluggish purchase causes stagnation in technology and slows down economic development.</span></p>

<h2 id="deflation-vs-inflation" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deflation vs Inflation</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">While deflation and inflation may seem like opposite sides of the same coin, they are both related to changes in the price of goods and services. Deflation, as we&#8217;ve discussed, refers to a decrease in the overall cost of goods and services, while inflation is the opposite, where the cost of living increases. Both high inflation and deflation can be harmful to an economy, so policymakers often strive to maintain a stable inflation rate.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deflation and inflation impact the economy in different ways, particularly through their influence on consumer behaviour and business operations. During deflation, the decreased cost of goods might initially seem like a boon to consumers, allowing them to buy more for less. However, as prices continue to fall, people may start postponing purchases in anticipation of even lower prices, which reduces overall demand and slows economic activity. This can lead businesses to decrease production, cut jobs, and lower wages, creating a cycle of reduced economic growth. Conversely, while inflation reduces the purchasing power of money, causing prices to rise, it can also stimulate spending and investment as people try to buy goods and services before prices go up further, potentially driving economic growth. Both scenarios pose challenges, but deflation can be particularly difficult to manage because it involves a sustained downward trend that can be hard to reverse once it takes hold.</span></p>

<h2 id="deflation-negative-effect" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Does Deflation Have Greater Negative Effects Than Inflation?</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Determining whether deflation is worse than inflation frequently depends on the particular economic context and how persistently price levels change. Some economists contend that depreciation is more challenging to control and can prolong the length of the economic downturn, as Japan has shown. Many people point out that high inflation can also cause economies to slack off, as have many developing nations.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Deflation can occur anytime, and it&#8217;s difficult to predict when it will occur.

<p><span id="more-30454"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br />
</strong><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-a-broker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is a broker?</a></h2>
<p>A financial broker conducts transactions between buyers and sellers of <a href="/en/markets" rel="noopener">financial products</a>. They earn a commission when the deal gets done. Some brokers will act as a buyer or seller and become a principal party. This basically means they take the other side of the trade. If you&#8217;re buying, it&#8217;s the broker that&#8217;s selling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20H%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Type%20of%20brokers%20(child%202)/analysis-trading-strategies-type-of-brokers-graph-image.jpg" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-type-of-brokers-graph-image" width="1200" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What is a stockbroker?</h3>
<p>A stockbroker is a regulated professional that (normally) represents a brokerage firm or broker-dealer. They buy and sell stocks (shares in a company) for both retail and institutional clients. Whilst their focus tends to be on stocks, they might also dabble in other securities like forex and <a href="/en/markets/commodities" rel="noopener">commodities</a>. Stock brokers will make trades on behalf of their clients through stock exchanges and get paid via fees and/ or commissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What is a broker-dealer?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A broker-dealer is another term for a financial broker. They work with individual investors or firms who want to buy and sell securities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Broker-dealer’s act as both a broker and as a dealer.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">When acting as a broker, they’re middlemen for transactions between two different investors exchanging securities.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">When acting as dealers, they are buying or selling for their benefit and on their account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What does a broker do?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brokers are middlemen between you and the trading world. They match buyers with sellers. If you want to sell an asset at one price, they will find a buyer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They now provide you with the trading platforms to take trades and give you the opportunity to be matched with either a buyer or seller (depending which one you are).</p>
<p>Due to the competitive nature of the forex broker industry, brokers are now doing more and more. They offer their clients education, tools, plus a host of services and products in an effort to appeal to their prospective clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">What qualifications do brokers need?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an individual broker within a brokerage, you don&#8217;t need to have any type of qualification. Some brokerages might have stricter requirements than others but in general, there is no requirement like there is for accountants, doctors or architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To open an execution brokerage business, no-one in the business needs any specific qualifications. To be authorised by certain regulatory bodies you must adhere to their standards and protocols. Each authority is different and will have its own level of compliance. It, therefore, depends on the country in which they operate and where they&#8217;re legally registered.</p>
<p>To be regulated by <a href="/en/about-us/atfx-regulators" rel="noopener">highly regarded authorities</a> like the FCA you must comply with strict protocols. Whilst you don&#8217;t need any qualifications to start a brokerage, the FCA will assess the experience, fitness, and propriety of senior management before agreeing to authorise them. It&#8217;s not like anyone can just open a brokerage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How do brokers make their money?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brokers make their money by charging you to execute a trade, both sides, when you’re buying and selling. Normally the charge comes in two forms, a commission per transaction or a spread &#8211; the difference between the price they quote you to buy and the price they quote you to sell. The actual price of the asset will be somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two prices you’re quoted are called the bid and the ask price. Here’s an example to show you how a broker makes money on a <a href="/en/markets/forex-trading" rel="noopener">forex trade</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The market price is 1.5000.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The spread of the currency pair is 2.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">You are trading at £10 a pip.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The bid price would be 1.4999.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The ask price would be 1.5001.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you buy in this market, you will enter the market at 1.5001 whilst the actual price is still at 1.5000.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">You enter at a loss because you are paying that 1 pip to the broker.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore you will pay the broker £10 to enter the trade.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Broker profit = £10.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spreads can be either fixed or variable. Variable spreads change depending on how the market moves. If there’s a significant economic event or data release such as an interest rate change, the spread could quickly change due to the volume of orders trying to get matched. Using the example above, if the spread widened to 3 during an announcement and you continued to buy, you would pay the broker £30 rather than £10.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brokers can also charge commissions and a spread on a trade. This would mean you pay the spread as per the above example but you would also be charged a set fee per transaction. You’d be wise to stay away from these types of brokers as costs can spiral.</p>
<p>Brokers who are well-capitalised and work with tier 1 banks usually offer the most competitive pricing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">What are the different types of brokers ?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several different types of brokers can execute your trades. There are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No dealing desk brokers (NDD)</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Electronic communication network brokers (ECN)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Straight-through processing brokers (STP)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Hybrids</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing desk brokers (DD)</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Market-makers</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1115px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20H%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Type%20of%20brokers%20(child%202)/analysistrading-strategies-type-of-brokers(child%202)-image2.jpg" alt="Type of trading brokers_what are the different types of broker" width="1115" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">No dealing desk brokers</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No dealing desk brokers (NDD) are, unsurprisingly, those that don’t operate dealing desks. Your order gets sent directly to the market without any interference or delay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NDD forex brokers will normally work directly with several liquidity providers to get you the most competitive prices.</p>
<p>With NDD brokers, you get direct exposure to the precise spreads available to customers from the interbank market. The precise spreads are normally passed on to the client but in order for them to make money they will apply exchange fees or commissions to your trades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">STP Broker</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A straight-through processing broker (STP) will route your order to the market ASAP without any delay and interference. Like most brokers, they make money from the spread and the commissions they generate on the trades you place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">STP brokers pass the orders directly to their liquidity provider. Liquidity providers can include Banks, Hedge Funds, Investment corporations or other brokers. STP brokers usually have several liquidity providers; increasing the number of providers in the liquidity system should, in theory, lead to better fills for the client. Many STP brokers use banks who trade on the Interbank market as their liquidity sources. The Interbank market is the highest-level foreign exchange market where banks exchange currencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few key facts about STP brokers:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They don’t pass orders through dealing desks</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They process clients requests without delay</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They don’t send re-quotes to clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They allow clients to trade during volatile periods (like news releases)</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">ECN Broker</h3>
<p class="blog-slider">An Electronic Communications Network (ECN) broker places your order into a liquidity pool of continually changing prices. The pool of pricing may be created by tier 1 banks who transact billions of FX requests and orders each day. ECN brokers attempt to get your market order filled at the best price and ASAP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ECN provides an electronic system for buyers and sellers to come together to execute trades. The network matches all the buying and selling orders in the pool of pricing (the exchange). If specific order information is not there, then the ECN delivers the highest bid and lowest ask price on the open market.</p>
<p class="blog-slider">All ECN brokers have access to the same feed and trade at the prices quoted. They’re popular because no trader should have a built-in advantage over the other.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Hybrid Broker (ECN + STP)</h3>
<p class="blog-slider">Brokers who offer the dual system of STP and ECN are known as hybrid brokers. Orders are routed to the ECN liquidity pool and market ASAP, without any interference or price manipulation. These hybrids are considered one of the most efficient, transparent and <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" rel="noopener">safest methods for traders</a> to access markets.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Dealing desk brokers</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name suggests, a dealing desk broker operates a dealing desk. The issue many have with brokers working dealing desks is that they often take the other side of a clients trade, therefore are the counterparty. This then throws up the question, does the broker have the clients best interest at heart when they’re the counterparty?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By setting the bid and ask price, there’s an argument that they have an advantage over their counterparty, in this case the client. Some people do believe that this type of trader takes advantage of traders but there are also many others that appreciate the fixed spreads that they do offer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Market Maker</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A market maker makes a market for their clients. They’re often liquidity suppliers &#8211; an entity that buys a large volume of an asset and then distributes it to other financial institutions who then make it available to retail investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Market makers offer a buy and sell quote to other financial companies, and they make a profit from this bid-offer spread. Their mission is to provide competitive quotes for the complete trading ecosystem.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">How do you choose a broker?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Choosing a broker is an important decision when you <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-start-trading-for-beginners" rel="noopener">start trading</a>. The charges they apply will have an affect on your bottom line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an example, imagine you&#8217;re an FX trader taking around ten trades a day. You pay an extra pip or two per transaction (let’s stick at the low level and call it 1), and you’re looking to bank on an average of ten pips per trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That means you’re looking to make 100 pips in a day. If you’re paying 1 pip to get in and 1 pip to get out of the trade, it means you have to make 12 pips on each trade to hit your target. That means you have to make 20% more profit to hit your 100 pip target. Minimising your transaction costs is essential.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">So how do you actually choose a broker? What’s the best process?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same way as choosing any provider. Doing your research and creating a checklist of everything you want in a broker. This might include security, value or customer service, or ideally all of the above. We’ve put together a few suggestions of the types of things you should have on your checklist when you’re doing your research</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20H%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Type%20of%20brokers%20(child%202)/analysistrading-strategies-type-of-brokers(child%202)-image1.png" alt="analysistrading-strategies-type-of-brokers(child 2)-image1" width="1200" /></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Regulation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are they regulated? Who are they regulated by? It’s always sensible to go with a regulated broker so do make sure this question makes it onto your checklist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reputation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do the clients of the broker say about them? Bad news travels quickly on the internet, especially in the trading community. So if the broker has lots of genuinely poor reviews, you might want to cross them off your list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Spreads and costs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How much is it going to cost you to trade with the broker? As we mentioned previously, this affects your bottom line, so make sure you’re on the hunt for value. As an example, anything over a 2.0 pip spread on EUR/USD is too much.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Support</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Will the broker offer you good support? Credible brokers will stress their <a href="/en/about-us/our-vision" rel="noopener">customer support</a>, sometimes, more than they’ll highlight their costs. They really want to deliver the best possible service to you because you’re more likely to stay with them. Loyalty repays loyalty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Trading services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is their trade execution and management like? You won’t know this unless you <a href="/en/trading-accounts/demo-account" rel="noopener">test their demo</a> or check whether they’ve <a href="/en/about-us/awards-and-recognitions" rel="noopener">won any awards</a>. Either way, having a platform and all the order types you need is important, so do look out for any clues they might give you (namely awards).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Education and tools</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do they want to make you better? A broker who wants you to improve, <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/why-do-day-traders-fail" rel="noopener">wants you to win</a>. That is something you’ll have in common with the broker … wanting to win. Check out their <a href="/en/education-and-tools" rel="noopener">tools and education</a> section to see what they have on offer, the more the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Legal status</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the legal status of the firm? Fairly self-explanatory. You want to go with a broker that’s a solvent Limited Company with a significant paid-up share capital to satisfy their regulators. Check their <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en/legal" rel=" noopener">legal section</a> for all the boring but important information.</p>
