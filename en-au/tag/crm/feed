<p style="text-align: center;">CRM – Daily Chart</p>
<p>CRM stock trades around $270, which is support from April and May. A strong number could see a return to a bullish tone, with $290 being the upside resistance level.</p>
<p>Salesforce has been underperforming the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> and <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq 100</a> this year. The company reported FY24 earnings, which showed revenue and earnings growing 11% and 50% year-over-year.</p>
<p>The company still sees strong growth in its Data Cloud segment as it drives robust innovation through the Einstein 1 Studio. At the same time, it has also announced plans to create an Einstein Copilot with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Salesforce is a leading provider of CRM software that helps businesses improve their sales pipeline and other areas related to sales and marketing.</p>
<p>The company said in its FY24 earnings in February that it had generated $34.9B in revenue for the full year, growing 11% YoY. Management added that eight out of 10 large deals in Q4 included six or more of their cloud products.</p>
<p>The company’s Data Cloud technology is now approaching $400 million in Annual Recurring Revenue “ARR”, which was up 90% YoY. Salesforce is expected to deliver approximately $9.145B in revenue in Q1, which would be another 11% growth. Operating margin is also expected to grow to 32.5%.</p>
<p>Analysts will be looking for strong figures and would prefer to see some international expansion as the company makes almost 70% of its income in the United States. Stronger earnings and management guidance around the cloud could see the stock set a low at this support level and seek to catch up with the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stock indices</a>.</p>
