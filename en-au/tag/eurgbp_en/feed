<figure id="attachment_50491" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50491" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50491" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="EURGBP - Daily Chart" width="646" height="546" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart-1.png 646w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart-1-300x254.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50491" class="wp-caption-text">EURGBP &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR v GBP has slumped from 0.87 in April to 0.84 and is at risk of further losses with a weak bounce. The support level below is the 0.8323 figure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s data starts at 3:30pm HKT with the release of PMI figures for Germany. A move from 48.4 to 48.9 is expected in manufacturing, with a 0.5 increase expected in services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same figures are released for the wider eurozone at 4pm, with gains expected in manufacturing. That will be followed by the UK data at 4:30pm, where a larger jump is expected in its PMI figures. That could show underlying strength in the UK economy and add to recent euro losses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK has recently been in talks with the eurozone on a Brexit reset deal. According to reports, the UK will be granted access to the EU’s £150 billion defence procurement scheme, while checks on food and agricultural equipment at the border are in line for a substantial reduction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics are calling it a ‘surrender deal,’ but financial analysis from Frontier Economics, who assessed how closer ties benefit the domestic economy earlier this year, say that the deal could be worth up to £25 billion annually for the UK. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain&#8217;s economy is expected to grow a little faster this year after a Reuters poll of economists, who see unexpectedly strong growth in the first quarter continuing. Sentiment has improved with the EU deal and a basic trade deal with the United States, which still leaves a 10% tariff on British goods but lowers duties on cars and steel.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The UK government is massively increasing spending this year. There&#8217;s a lot of money coming in and that&#8217;s going to act as a bit of a tailwind as well. Real wage growth is also still quite strong, so the economy still has some reasonable underpinnings&#8221;, said James Smith, economist at ING. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK economy seems to have more positive near-term sentiment than its European counterpart and that can boost the British pound, with PMI figures giving a chance to add further gains. </span></p>

<figure id="attachment_49088" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49088" style="width: 793px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-49088" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURGBP - Daily Chart" width="793" height="535" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart.png 793w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart-300x202.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart-768x518.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49088" class="wp-caption-text">EURGBP &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURGBP</a> has dipped below support at the January high around 0.8450. That is the key level to avoid a further drop to the 0.8320 level.</p>
<p>The UK employment levels for April were released on Tuesday at 14:00 HKT. Markets are looking for an improvement from last month’s 206k jobs ahead. Despite the increase in jobs, the unemployment rate is still around 4.4% and the expectation is for 4.4%.</p>
<p>German consumer prices will be released at the same time on Wednesday. Markets expect the indicator to remain at 2.2%. Any deviation could affect European rate outlooks. The country’s new government has inherited a heavy legacy that provides significant challenges to growth, according to QNB. Germany has been the economic powerhouse of Europe since the war, but the last two decades has seen a slowdown.</p>
<p>Negative demographic trends, excess regulatory and tax burdens, and the inability to modernize its industry for the digital age. Germany’s economy has underperformed, with real GDP remaining unchanged in the last five years. This compares poorly with a 12.2% expansion for the United States, or the 5% growth for the rest of the Euro area during the same period.</p>
<p>The incoming administration led by new Chancellor Friedrich Merz wants to create a turning point in economic policy and performance. Decades of fiscal discipline and austerity are about to be abandoned for a massive fiscal expansion package that could reach €1tn, including infrastructure and defence.</p>
<p>Tariffs and trade uncertainty are not leading to a “dramatic” shift in the UK economy, the Bank of England’s chief economist has said, after noting “misleading” views on the impact of the new UK-US trade deal.</p>
<p>Huw Pill’s remarks came after the Bank cut interest rates to 4.25% and lowered its outlook for UK economic growth next year. He said: “I think it is important to say that the analysis in the baseline forecast does not suggest that there’s a dramatic shift in the behaviour of the UK economy, on the back of these trade announcements and trade uncertainty.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Local players are now seeking greater US dollar hedging, as well as starting to diversify away from US investments,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The British pound has mounted a recovery against the euro and will look for further gains from data this week.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURGBP – 4H Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURGBP is looking to find support ahead of the 0.83 level and any gains would target the 0.8450 level again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufacturing and services PMI is released for the eurozone between 4:30pm HKT and 5:30pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France’s economy starts the show but its figures are still expected to be around the 46 level, lower than the 50 expansion rate. Germany’s services is expected to grow with a 51.4 reading, but its manufacturing is still lagging with a forecast of 47.7. Eurozone services is expected to be 51, with manufacturing at 48.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be a similar situation for the UK economy at 5:30pm HKT with manufacturing expected to be 47.3, with services at 51.2. Any deviation in these numbers could have an effect on the pair into Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound has been recovering against the euro, despite the surprise slowdown in </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/market-news/gbpusd-awaits-british-gdp-growth-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK GDP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth numbers last week. The economy contracted by -0.1% when analysts had expected growth of a similar level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets are now pricing in a rate cut from the ECB in April, with Governing Council member Yannis Stournaras, saying:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything points in the direction of a cut in April. But this is not April. It is still March. We have one month to go, so I cannot tell you that we’re going to cut”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data on Monday could add to euro rate cut expectations if PMI data from the eurozone disappoints.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EURGBP exchange rate has rallied in recent days as the single currency forces short-covering against other global </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46497" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURGBP-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURGBP – Daily Chart" width="841" height="570" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURGBP-–-Daily-Chart.png 841w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURGBP-–-Daily-Chart-300x203.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURGBP-–-Daily-Chart-768x521.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURGBP – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the EURGBP has rallied from the 2024 support at 0.8248 and hit the 0.84 level. This could start a larger rebound in the euro with 0.8450 the next target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European economy will have data at 3pm HKT with German factory orders and UK house prices. These may not affect the currency pair too much but analysts see a -2.8% drop in factory orders after a 6.9% gain in the previous month. A more positive figure could boost the euro against the British pound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a stronger set of figures coming for traders staying on later, with 5:30pm HKT bringing a speech from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. That will be followed by GDP growth data at 6pm with traders expecting to see a quarterly return of 0.1%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lagarde warned Thursday that the eurozone faces &#8220;risks all over&#8221; after tariffs and massive German spending plans, as policymakers cut rates again but said future monetary easing was in doubt. That has led to a surge in the euro in recent days as traders expect a slower rate cut cycle. Germany’s incoming government will now look to ease debt rules as it seeks to spend huge amounts on defense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent,” Friedrich Merz said. The motto “whatever it takes” must now apply to the country’s defense, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merz suggested that defense spending above 1% of gross domestic product be exempted from the restrictions of Germany’s constitutional debt brake, which limits the structural budget deficit to 0.35% of gross domestic product.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURGBP – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR v GBP has a big support level in play around the 2022 lows near 0.82. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR v GBP will hear from ECB President Christine Lagarde at 2pm HKT on Monday. That will be followed by the BoE’s Governor Andrew Bailey on Tuesday at 8:45am. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That decision to cut was widely expected in financial markets but the growth rate is still an issue for the central bank and the UK government. Despite the negative outlook, the pound was able to hold up against the euro as traders expect a quicker rate reduction from Europe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will be welcome news to many that we have been able to cut interest rates again,” said Bailey. Mortgage holders would agree, but savers will not. Inflation may also subside but due to falling wage or workers’ bargaining power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country’s chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the action would “ease cost of living pressures”.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the eurozone, the ECB said in a recent paper that the bank has “several” interest rate cuts left before it hits a neutral rate. The EURGBP could move this week as traders digest new comments and a possible timeline.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURGBP</a> exchange rate has central bank action ahead on Wednesday as the pair trades at a key support level.</p>
<p><strong> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-43540 size-full" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/eur-gbp-daily-chart.png" alt="eur-gbp-daily-chart" width="903" height="623" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/eur-gbp-daily-chart.png 903w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/eur-gbp-daily-chart-300x207.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/eur-gbp-daily-chart-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">EURGBP – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of EURGBP has been on a three day downtrend and is looking toward the 0.8267 support. The trend may be more pronounced but GBP weakness is an issue due to government taxes and policy.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron is fighting against a political and economic crisis as Paris&#8217; borrowing costs briefly exceeded Greece&#8217;s for the first time on Wednesday. Greece was at the centre of the European debt crisis in 2010, so the development is embarrassing for France.</p>
<p>In the bond market, where issued debt is traded, Greek bonds were priced at 3.02%, while French bonds rose to 3.05%. The economic woes are being driven by Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s struggles to gain support for the 2025 budget. He wants to cut spending and raise taxes to try and tackle the country’s deficit.</p>
<p>France’s problems are deep and the attempts to stimulate the economy have added to the problem. The country’s budget deficit is now 6% of GDP, while its debt-to-GDP ratio has surged to 112%, up from 95% in 2015. Last year, Macron faced widespread protests over his decision to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently warned that France’s fiscal trajectory is unsustainable without major reforms.</p>
<p>The recent activity has hit the euro against global currencies and may have caused more damage against the British pound if the UK did not have its own struggles. Keir Starmer’s government has only been in power four months but has faced protests from farmers, backlash from business and a petition from 2 million citizens calling for another election.</p>
<p>Many believe the government has backtracked on its manifesto to avoid raising taxes. Budget airline Ryanair was the latest to protest, saying that they will reduce the number of domestic flights due to the Labour Party’s tax raid.</p>
<p>The economic calendar is busy on Friday for the UK and Europe around 3pm HKT. British house prices and numbers on mortgages and credit will be released. Germany will release unemployment figures, alongside European consumer price inflation.</p>
<p>The German employment picture is worsening as the auto industry makes job cuts. Slow demand for electric vehicles and lower Chinese exports has hurt the former European powerhouse.</p>
<p>The EURGBP exchange rate is a tale of two troubled economies and volatility is likely to persist.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURGBP &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of EURGBP has been looking to secure a low around the 0.8300 level. The first obstacle to further gains comes in at 0.8448. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data ahead on Wednesday comes in the form of European producer prices at 3pm HKT. That will show if European firms are passing on inflationary prices, but the trend has been in decline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data will also be released at the same time from the British economy with consumer price index numbers. The inflation pressures have also been lowered in the UK but rates are not coming down in a quick manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK on Tuesday, thousands of farmers descended on Westminster to protest against the new government’s inheritance tax raid. Farmers are concerned that their future business will be impacted and the ability to pass on their legacy to their children will also be hampered. The protests are one more criticism against the Labour government which has already broken its manifesto to avoid any tax hikes on workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer confidence data for the UK this week showed a hit in November after rising earlier in the year, with concerns the trend may decline further into 2025. The S&amp;P Global Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) showed a decrease in confidence from 47.3 in October to 46.9 in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;P, said: &#8220;ongoing pressure on household finances has resulted in squeezed spending, higher debt, and lower savings&#8221;. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey says he voted to cut borrowing costs due to the “pace and progress on disinflation”, which was faster than expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slower inflation and economic worries about the UK economy have the euro in bounce mode and data ahead could test the recent rally ahead of the next central bank meetings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the European Central Bank, there should be a &#8220;focus on the sluggishness of the real economy&#8221; and move official interest rates into &#8220;neutral, or even expansionary, territory,&#8221; said ECB policy member Leon Panetta. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the European and UK economies have been struggling to see real growth with Britain showing a 0.1% quarterly gain recently.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39094" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EURGBP-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="EURGBP – Weekly Chart" width="865" height="576" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EURGBP-–-Weekly-Chart.png 865w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EURGBP-–-Weekly-Chart-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EURGBP-–-Weekly-Chart-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURGBP – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURGBP has been rallying since mid-July and found resistance in recent days. This will be the key obstacle to further gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&#8217;s high-level UK economic data will test the case for the Bank of England&#8217;s policy makers not to cut interest rates next month. That will be due to expected higher inflation for the first time this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) will release its latest reading on Wednesday. City economists say consumer prices will accelerate to 2.3% in July. That would be the first uptick in inflation since last December and slightly ahead of the central bank&#8217;s 2% target in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a slowdown in services prices, analysts expect pressure from a sharp fall in energy prices last July, which came out of the annual figure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of England cut rates in August, but higher prices may force a pause in September. Markets expect two more 25-basis-point cuts by the end of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of that data, there is also UK employment at 2 pm HKT, followed by German and Eurozone economic sentiment data at 5 pm. The British economy created 19k jobs last month and will look to build on that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A drop in European sentiment is expected from 41.8 to 38 as the mood sours a little among economists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to economists, the European Central Bank is expected to cut its benchmark rate once each quarter through the end of next year. The economy also saw inflation rise to 2.6%, but economists expect further rate cuts this year.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37311" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EURGBP-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="EURGBP – Weekly Chart" width="934" height="610" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EURGBP-–-Weekly-Chart.png 934w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EURGBP-–-Weekly-Chart-300x196.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EURGBP-–-Weekly-Chart-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURGBP – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURGBP is trading below the previous strong support of around 0.85. There is no room below for a test of lower levels at 0.8346 and 0.8250. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound has been stronger after the French elections and an election in the UK. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are assessing the outlook for taxes and interest rates in the UK after the Labour Party won last week&#8217;s election by a landslide. Labour has promised an overhaul of the welfare system. However, the main focus will be reducing economic inactivity and getting more people into the workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marine Le Pen won the first round of elections in France but not with the projected initial majority. That keeps Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s party safe for now but only adds confusion about the country&#8217;s future path of government. Many voters are angry with Macron&#8217;s extended term and want to see changes happen soon. Any downturn in the economy in Europe would cause these tensions to worsen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is released for the pair on Thursday, with inflation figures for Germany and growth figures for the UK coming out at 2 p.m. HKT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The German pricing data is expected to dip from 2.4% to 2.2% as inflation continues in the Eurozone. The UK&#8217;s growth figures are expected to be 0.7%, equal to the previous month. The annual figure is expected to be 1.2% from 0.6%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists noted last month&#8217;s figures, showing consumers spent much more than expected on clothing and furniture. Better weather is also likely to have improved the construction sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts at Capital Economics said they expected the &#8220;economic recovery to resume in May,&#8221; Deutsche Bank said growth in the UK would &#8220;bounce back&#8221;.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">EURGBP &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURGBP</a> price faces strong resistance at the 0.85060 level. If further weakness emerges, the pair has support at the 0.8246 level.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron is facing the prospect of a humiliating defeat at the hands of National Rally (RN), led by Marine Le Pen. A new poll said his decision to call a snap election after his party was defeated in European elections is set to backfire.</p>
<p>French voters go to the polls on June 30, and the pro-Macron coalition of parties, which includes the President&#8217;s Renaissance party, has 19.5 percent of the vote. The Ipsos poll for Le Monde newspaper has the RN party with 36% and the left-wing coalition New Popular Front with 29%.</p>
<p>The election could seriously affect French policy, as Macron would be compelled to appoint a prime minister from the largest party. Under the French constitution, the PM is charged with running domestic affairs, while the president only has influence over defence and foreign policy.</p>
<p>The EURGBP also has economic data to absorb tomorrow with the 14:45 pm HKT release of French inflation data. The preliminary number for June could move closer to the 2% target after 2.3% last month. German unemployment will follow at 15:55, and markets expect a smaller 15k increase over last month&#8217;s 25k. Finally, Italy also sees inflation released at 5 pm HKT.</p>
<p>The French elections are on a Sunday, which could add volatility to the Sunday open for the FX market. The following week will be highlighted by European inflation and the UK&#8217;s election on July 4. Britain is also expected to see a leadership change as Rishi Sunak&#8217;s Conservative poll lags the Labour Party by a wide margin.</p>
