										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In forex trading, opening a position is just the beginning. For traders following a position trading strategy, learning when and how to add positions is key to maximizing opportunities. Besides simply setting a position, a seasoned position trader manages trades dynamically, building into trends or adjusting entries as market conditions evolve.</p>
<p>At ATFX, we believe that understanding positional trading techniques and applying them wisely within a solid risk management plan, is essential to trading successfully.</p>
<h2>1. What Is Position Trading?</h2>
<p>Position trading is a long-term approach where traders hold positions for extended periods, typically ranging from days to weeks or even months. The goal is to capture major price movements by aligning trades with broader economic or fundamental trends.</p>
<p>When asking <em>“what is positional trading,”</em> think of it as the opposite of scalping or day trading. Instead of reacting to short-term volatility, a position trader takes fewer, more deliberate trades based on a macro view of the market. This approach often relies on fundamental analysis, supported by technical confirmation.</p>
<h2>2. Pros and Cons of Position Trading</h2>
<p>Before applying any position trading strategy, it’s essential to weigh the benefits and trade-offs. Long-term trading can offer stability, but it’s not without challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower trade frequency:</strong> Fewer trades mean lower transaction costs and less emotional pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with macro trends:</strong> A position trader typically rides broader trends backed by strong economic narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Less screen time:</strong> Positional trading does not demand constant monitoring, offering more flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requires patience and discipline:</strong> Trades may take days or weeks to develop.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to macro events:</strong> Holding through weekends or data releases increases risk.</li>
<li><strong>Prolonged drawdowns:</strong> Market reversals or consolidations can test a trader’s conviction and capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these trade-offs helps traders assess if position trading suits their personality, strategy, and risk appetite.</p>
<h2>3. Why Add Positions?</h2>
<p>In many positional trading techniques, adding positions is a tactical way to manage capital, improve average entry price, or build into momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Adding Positions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximize profits:</strong> Leverage a winning trend by adding positions to amplify returns.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalise on favourable price action:</strong> Adding to a position when market signals confirm a good opportunity</li>
<li><strong>Efficient capital deployment:</strong> Gradually scaling in reduces initial risk while maintaining flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, without solid risk management, adding can lead to overexposure, particularly if the market turns suddenly.</p>
<p>Before placing a trade, use a <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/position-size-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">position size calculator</a> to determine how many units to buy or sell based on your account size, risk tolerance, and stop-loss level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trader-magazine"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-45553 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-1024x256.jpg" alt="Trader Magazine-High" width="800" height="200" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h2>4. Pyramiding &#8211; Adding to Winning Trades for Position Trading Strategy &amp; Technique</h2>
<p>Pyramiding is a smart way for a position trader to build on strength. This technique involves adding to a position only when it becomes profitable, often after a pullback or breakout confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open an initial position with modest size.</li>
<li>As the price moves in your favour, add smaller positions at key intervals.</li>
<li>Use trailing stops or layered risk to protect profits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why It Works in Position Trading:</strong></p>
<p>It uses unrealized gains to increase exposure without increasing initial risk, making it one of the most effective positional trading techniques for trending markets.</p>
<p><strong>Best used in:</strong> Strong, directional markets where momentum is clear and sustained.</p>
<h2>5. Averaging Down &#8211; Adding to Losing Trades</h2>
<p>A more controversial position trading strategy is averaging down, where a trader adds to a losing position as the market moves against them, aiming to lower the average entry price.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>You buy GBP/USD at 1.2500. Price drops to 1.2450, so you buy again. While each <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/ways-to-trade/cfd-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second Contract trade</a> is separate, most platforms display a combined average entry price, making recovery easier if the market rebounds.</p>
<p><strong>Risk: </strong>If the trend continues against you, losses snowball. This technique requires strict risk control and should only be used in ranging markets or during temporary corrections within broader trends.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Experienced traders with high conviction and defined risk limits.</p>
<h2>6. Martingale Strategy &#8211; Doubling Down Aggressively</h2>
<p>The Martingale system takes averaging down to the extreme, by doubling the position size after each losing trade, aiming to recover with a single win.</p>
<p><strong>Why It’s Risky:</strong></p>
<p>It assumes the market will eventually reverse. But prolonged losing streaks can wipe out an account. While it may appeal to high-risk traders, it’s generally not suitable for most position traders.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Advanced traders maintaining a high margin level and strong risk management, and even then, cautiously.</p>
<h2>7. Grid Trading &#8211; Adding Positions at Regular Intervals</h2>
<p>Grid trading places buy and sell orders at fixed price intervals above and below the market, regardless of trend direction.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a “grid” of pending orders.</li>
<li>As price fluctuates, positions are triggered and closed based on movement.</li>
<li>Profits are harvested in increments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for Position Traders?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in sideways markets. However, in trending markets, grids can lead to large drawdowns if trades are not managed or hedged.</p>
<p><strong>Best used in:</strong> Range-bound or consolidating markets, often with Electronic Advisor (EA) support.</p>
<h2>8. Scaling In Before Confirmation &#8211; Aggressive Entry Strategy</h2>
<p>Some advanced traders choose to scale in before confirmation, entering with a small position based on early price action signals.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use It: </strong>You gain early exposure and can capitalise if the trend unfolds. If you&#8217;re wrong, the loss is small due to low initial size.</p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong> Higher chance of being stopped out in whipsaws or false breakouts.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Skilled traders who are confident reading market structure and know when to exit fast.</p>
<h5><strong>Final Thoughts from ATFX for Position Trading</strong></h5>
<p>Adding positions can strengthen a position trading strategy too close together when guided by clarity, discipline, and market awareness. Whether you&#8217;re building into trends with pyramiding or managing ranges with grid setups, success depends on choosing the right technique and managing risk effectively.</p>
<p>ATFX equip position traders with powerful tools, expert insights, and advanced platform features to help you trade smarter.</p>
<p><strong>Trade with precision. Stay in control. And in position trading, one good entry can be the start of something big.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-derivative" dir="ltr">What is a Derivative?</h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">A derivative is a financial contract in which the underlying asset decides the value. This asset can be anything that changes in value, such as stocks, bonds, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commodities</a>, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currencies</a>, interest rates, or <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indices</a>. Derivatives are frequently used to manage or reduce financial risk, speculate on future asset price changes, and increase leverage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both institutional and individual investors regularly use derivatives. For example, corporations may use futures to hedge against volatility in raw material costs. Consider an airline that relies significantly on jet fuel; rising fuel prices may diminish its income. To avoid this risk, the airline might sign a fuel derivative contract that guarantees a specific fuel price, allowing it to maintain steady operational costs.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="types-of-derivatives" dir="ltr">Types of Derivatives</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The derivatives market offers a range of contract types, each with distinct features tailored for various uses. Here is a complete analysis of the main categories of derivatives:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Futures: Futures are standardised contracts for buying or selling an asset at a specific price on a future date. These contracts are tightly regulated and traded on markets like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). A wheat farmer, for example, may use a futures contract to lock in a favourable selling price for the upcoming harvest to protect against future price declines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Options: Options provide the holder the right (but not the duty) to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a defined price before the option expires. They can be used for both loss prevention and speculative purposes. If investors predict a stock&#8217;s price will rise, they can purchase a call option to benefit without buying the shares.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Swaps: Swaps are agreements that enable the exchange of financial assets or liabilities. The most common type is an interest rate swap, which involves parties exchanging fixed interest payments for variable ones. For example, a firm with a variable-rate loan may enter into a swap agreement to pay fixed interest rates, reducing its exposure to the risks of rising interest rates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Forwards: Forward contracts, like futures, are agreements to purchase or sell an item at a fixed price at a later date. However, they are more flexible and are traded over-the-counter (OTC). The flexibility to customize these contracts allows the parties involved to adjust the terms. However, this also increases counterparty risk because they are not traded on standard exchanges.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Contracts for Difference (Second Contract)</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Second Contract are derivative products that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of assets such as forex, stocks, commodities (Oil, Gold), or indices..etc without owning the underlying asset. Traders can profit from both rising and falling markets by taking long (buy) or short (sell) positions.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Leverage: Second Contract often involve leverage, allowing traders to control a larger position with a smaller capital outlay. While this amplifies potential profits, it also increases the risk of significant losses.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Flexibility: Second Contract provide access to a wide range of markets and are traded over the counter, offering greater trading flexibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Second Contract are popular among traders looking for short-term opportunities and those seeking to hedge their existing portfolios.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each type of derivative provides unique strategies for managing financial risks, helping traders capitalise on price swings, and discover new investment opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-derivatives-trading" dir="ltr">What is Derivatives Trading?</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives trading is the purchase and sale of derivatives contracts to hedge risks or benefit from projected price changes in underlying assets. Unlike direct investments in assets like stocks and bonds, derivatives allow traders to profit from price fluctuations without owning the underlying asset.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, a derivatives trader betting on <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crude oil prices </a>may buy oil futures if prices are expected to climb. If oil prices rise, the trader can profitably sell futures contracts. Businesses use futures to control their expenses or profits, hedging against market fluctuations that could hurt their earnings.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="how-derivatives-trading-works" dir="ltr">How Derivatives Trading Works</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The workings of derivatives trading can be complex since they differ based on the derivative and the trader&#8217;s goals. Below is a broad outline of how derivatives trading functions:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Contract Creation: The first step is to create or acquire a derivative contract. Exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures and options, contain standard contract terms accessible to everyone with a trading account. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as swaps and forwards, are traded privately, each with unique terms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leverage and Margin: Traders typically trade derivatives on margin, meaning they must put down a portion of the total contract value to begin the transaction. This leverage allows for huge exposure with a small initial investment, increasing the chances of more significant losses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-45550 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin-1024x529.webp" alt="leverage-and-margin" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/leverage-and-margin.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Fluctuating Value: The value of a derivative contract fluctuates in response to the underlying asset&#8217;s price. For example, the value of a stock option contract fluctuates as the underlying stock price changes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Settlement: Many derivatives, particularly futures contracts, can be settled (closed out) before their expiration. Specific contracts may require physical delivery of the underlying item at expiration, whilst others need a cash settlement based on the current market price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ability to amplify returns and their adaptability gives derivatives their strength, but they also carry significant risks, particularly if the market shifts against a trader&#8217;s predictions.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-derivatives-trading" dir="ltr">Pros &amp; Cons of Derivatives Trading</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">Pros</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">Risk Management and Hedging Options</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives are effective risk management instruments that allow investors to hedge against unfavourable price movements in the underlying assets. For example, a corporation facing foreign currency risk could use currency futures to lock in a favourable exchange rate, reducing the financial impact of future currency fluctuations.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Amplified Returns through Leverage</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Traders may control massive holdings with a modest investment by using leverage on derivatives. This enables companies to generate more significant returns from a lower initial investment, allowing them to capitalise on market movements without requiring substantial upfront cash.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Market Access and Diversification</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives provide access to a variety of markets, such as commodities, currencies, interest rates, and equity indices, allowing for diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds. This diversification decreases investment risk by exposing you to a wide range of asset classes, each of which may react differently to economic conditions.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Enhanced Market Efficiency</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The derivatives market is crucial for determining prices, as the prices of derivatives frequently signal anticipated future values of the underlying assets. For example, stock options can reveal the market&#8217;s perspective on a stock&#8217;s expected volatility, aiding investors in making better-informed choices.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Income Generation through Option Premiums</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Selling options (such as covered calls) allow investors to earn an income from the premium received, which can supplement returns and improve overall portfolio performance. This income generation is appropriate in relatively stable markets, where the likelihood of options being exercised is lower, providing a steady cash flow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-accounts/demo-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-45551 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality-1024x256.jpg" alt="Demo-White-High-Quality" width="800" height="200" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Demo-White-High-Quality.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Cons</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">High risk due to leverage</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Although leverage can increase your earnings, it also significantly increases the possibility of loss, making derivatives risky for people with no expertise. A slightly negative price movement in a leveraged position can result in significant financial losses, potentially exceeding the initial investment.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Complexity and Knowledge Requirements</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives are complex financial instruments requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying assets, contract terms, and market circumstances. Furthermore, concepts like the &#8220;Greeks&#8221; of options (which evaluate price reaction to market movements) add complexity that inexperienced traders may find difficult to grasp.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Counterparty Risk in OTC Derivatives</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are privately negotiated, exposing traders to risk if the counterparty fails to meet their contractual obligations. Unlike exchange-traded derivatives, which use intermediaries to reduce risk, OTC derivatives rely on each participant&#8217;s creditworthiness, adding another risk layer.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Sensitivity to Market Volatility</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Derivatives&#8217; values can vary quickly owing to changes in the underlying asset prices, making them highly vulnerable to market swings. This sensitivity suggests that trading derivatives for speculative purposes could result in large profits or losses quickly, particularly in volatile assets like commodities and currencies.</p>
<ol class="no-markers" start="6">
<li dir="ltr">
<h2 id="derivatives-trading-strategies" dir="ltr">Derivatives Trading Strategies</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Traders use several ways to increase their earnings or reduce their risk exposure in derivatives trading. Here are four popular strategies:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hedging: Hedging entails utilising derivatives to mitigate potential losses in a primary investment. For example, a coffee vendor expecting price increases may purchase coffee futures to lock in current lower prices and limit cost volatility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speculation: Speculative tactics attempt to appropriately forecast swings in asset values and trade derivatives. For example, if a trader believes gold prices will climb, they may buy a call option on gold, allowing them to profit if the price does rise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Arbitrage: This approach seeks to profit on price differences across related assets or marketplaces by buying a derivative in one market and selling it in another. For example, traders may purchase an investment in one country&#8217;s market and sell it for a higher price in another, benefitting from the difference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pairs Trading: Investors may maintain opposite positions in two closely linked assets to profit from performance variances. For example, a trader may shorten an airline stock while going long on an oil company, anticipating that changes in oil prices will affect the two businesses differently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each approach requires a unique risk management methodology, and knowing these strategies is crucial for successfully navigating the derivatives market.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion" dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">Derivative trading effectively controls risk, facilitates market exposure, and increases returns. While corporations and institutions use them widely, derivatives also appeal to individual traders seeking advanced strategies. However, investing in derivatives trading carries significant risks, most notably the possibility of sustaining magnified losses. Individuals new to trading derivatives must first gather information and carefully establish their methods to achieve both success and safety in their trading attempts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>What is EUR/USD</strong></h2>
<p>EURUSD is the exchange rate value of one euro to US dollars. It indicates how many US dollars (USD) are needed to purchase one euro (EUR). For example, if the EUR/USD rate is 1.50, it means that 1 euro can be exchanged for 1.50 US dollars.</p>
<p>EURUSD pair is the most traded currency pair globally, making up a major portion of the forex market. EURUSD has more liquidity, tighter spreads, and greater market depth compared to GBP/USD and USD/JPY.</p>
<h2><strong>Examples of the EUR/USD Exchange Rate</strong></h2>
<p>For example, if a European company sells goods worth €10,000 to a US company, and the EUR/USD rate is 1.20, the US company will need to pay $12,000 (10,000 x 1.20) for the goods.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the rate drops to 1.10, the same goods would cost the US company $11,000. This demonstrates the direct impact of exchange rates on international trade.</p>
<h2><strong>Why is the EUR/USD Structured with the Euro as the Base Currency?</strong></h2>
<p>EUR/USD currency pairs use euro as the base currency, and the US dollar is the quoted currency. This structure is somewhat unique because, in most currency pairs, the US dollar typically serves as the base currency. The EURUSD shows the euro&#8217;s important role in the global economy, highlighting the Eurozone&#8217;s economic power.</p>
<h2><strong>The Differences Between EUR/USD and USD/EUR</strong></h2>
<p>EUR/USD shows the dollars needed to buy one euro, while USD/EUR shows the euros needed to buy one dollar. For example, if EUR/USD is 1.20, then USD/EUR is 0.8333 (1/1.20).</p>
<p>This inverse relationship impacts traders’ strategies and economic interpretations, highlighting the need to understand which currency is the base and which is the quote.</p>

<h2><strong>Major Factors that Impact the Euro to Dollar Exchange Rate</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Interest rate differences set by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) can drive demand for euros or dollars.</li>
<li>Economic indicators like GDP growth, employment rates, and inflation figures from the Eurozone and the US can significantly impact the exchange rate.</li>
<li>Geopolitical events like political stability, trade agreements, and international conflicts can change market perceptions and currency values.</li>
<li>Economic events like changes in monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, and crises can significantly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Role of International Trade Between Europe and the USA</strong></h3>
<p>A trade surplus in the Eurozone means higher demand for euros, potentially strengthening the EUR/USD rate. Conversely, a trade deficit could weaken the euro against the dollar.</p>
<h2><strong>History of the Euro to Dollar</strong></h2>
<p>EUR/USD currency pair has changed significantly since the euro was introduced on 1 January 1999. Initially, the euro was valued lower than the dollar, but it gained strength, peaking at around 1.60 in 2008.</p>
<p>These changes reflect the economic conditions and monetary policies of the Eurozone and the US. Historical analysis shows that the EUR/USD exchange rate follows patterns influenced by macroeconomic trends, such as shifts in economic growth and policy differences between the ECB and the Fed.</p>
<p>The relationship between the euro and the dollar has evolved through various economic cycles, including the 2008 global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, and uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each event has left a distinct mark on the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/eur-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EUR/USD exchange rate live chart</a>, as shown on the live chart.</p>

<h2><strong>Why is the EUR/USD Pair Considered the Most Traded Currency Pair?</strong></h2>
<p>The EUR/USD currency pair is the most traded due to the Eurozone&#8217;s economic size. Its high liquidity allows traders to enter and exit positions with minimal slippage, making EUR/USD an attractive option for forex traders.</p>
<p>The EUR/USD currency pair&#8217;s high liquidity allows for diverse trading strategies, including spot trading, Contracts for Difference (Second Contract), and spread betting.</p>
<h2><strong>EUR/USD Trading Hours</strong></h2>
<p>EUR/USD operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, with forex market trading sessions in Sydney, Tokyo, London, and New York. The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/best-time-to-trade-eurusd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURUSD best trading times</a> are during the London and New York overlap (12:00 PM to 4:00 PM GMT), offering high liquidity and volatility, making it ideal for short-term trades due to significant price movements and opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The financial markets have many unique terms that might confuse beginner traders. This article shall cover the main differences between spot, futures, and contracts for differences (SPC) trading.</p>
<p><span id="more-39832"></span></p>
<p>Depending on where an investor was raised, they could have difficulty understanding some of the terms used in the <a href="/en-au/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global financial markets</a>. For example, many beginner Chinese traders may have challenges understanding terms such as ETF, Second Contract, swap fees and discounts, given that English is not their first language.</p>
<p>However, we cannot dive into the intricacies of trading all the popular types of assets since that would need a whole book. Still, we can focus on the <a href="/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign exchange</a> markets and analyse the differences between spot, futures and Second Contract, which are the main types of assets that investors will encounter when trading using the popular MT4 platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 825px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX-spot-vs-future-vs-contract%20(1).jpg" alt="ATFX-spot-vs-future-vs-contract (1)" width="825" /></p>
<h2>1. Spot</h2>
<p>Spot transactions usually have another group of abbreviations that appear with them, such as OTC, which means over-the-counter transactions.</p>
<p>The financial market&#8217;s restriction on spot transactions includes the delivery of cash and commodities within two working(trading) days if it is a spot transaction. There are different versions of the  XAUUSD gold asset on the MT4 for Mac, PC, iOS, Android applications, which many people think are spot prices, but they are not.</p>
<p>Spot transactions require the buyer to take delivery of physical gold within two working days, while the seller has to deliver physical gold to the buyer. Therefore, most of the gold trades executed by investors and traders alike are not spot transactions.</p>
<p>However, if you decide to take your cash and approach the bank to buy gold bars, the physical gold engraved with &#8220;investment gold&#8221; is spot gold.</p>
<p>Transactions in the Chinese A-share market are regarded as spot transactions because the equity of a listed company is reflected in your investment account when you buy the firm’s shares, which meets the definition of a spot. Although spot transactions usually result in the physical settlement of actual commodities, they also present the inconvenience of storing the commodity and high processing fees.</p>
<p>Many people who trade commodities are not interested in physical commodities but are solely interested in price fluctuations. Likewise, most traders and investors are interested in speculating on future price movements, not the actual delivery of the asset.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have now exposed the shortcomings of spot transactions, and it is now time to focus on futures, including their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/Others%20folders/ATFX%20Blog%20Image%202020/ATFX-spot-transaction.jpg" alt="ATFX-spot-transaction" width="1200" /></p>
<h2>2. Futures</h2>
<p>Futures are different from spot transactions, but they are also related to spot prices. Futures represent the expected prices at a future date, while spot prices are the current market prices. Most people do not understand the mechanism by which futures prices are quoted, which makes them think that futures prices are unpredictable. So, how can futures provide accurate future price quotations? While this is a valid question, traders will see futures prices fluctuating as market conditions reflect current and projected market volatility. Therefore, we cannot judge the different quotes we receive when trading futures, which typically reflect the price changes in the underlying assets.</p>
<p>For example, crude oil futures. The current December contract listed on the MT4 corresponds to the expected crude oil price in December, a few months away. The price of this futures contract is determined by traders and analysts based on a comprehensive analysis of various factors.</p>
<p>Some of the factors considered include the demand and corresponding supply of crude oil globally.  As December approaches, we will likely see the crude oil prices being very close to the spot crude oil prices. However, there are no guarantees that the prices will be the same.</p>
<p>The most significant difference between futures and spot transactions is that futures can only be delivered on the expiry date, while spot transactions are delivered within two days. The concept of delivery is quite simple. That is, the physical goods purchased by the trader are shipped to them by the seller. If you close your position before the expiry date, you do not need to take delivery of the assets you were trading. However, you must understand that the delivery process is quite complicated. Unless you are a large institution, ordinary traders and investors generally don&#8217;t want to accept deliveries in the futures market because the products delivered are often in large quantities, and the shipping and handling fee is usually extremely high. The traders also need to prepare their warehouses and trucks to stock and transport the delivered commodities.</p>
<p>Many people think that the <a href="/en-au/markets/commodities/oil-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crude oil trading</a> done on the MT4 platform is based on futures. However, the above misconception is not true since traders cannot take delivery of the crude oil traded on the MT4. Instead, the crude oil traded on the MT4 operates on a “cash delivery” system where traders do not receive actual crude oil on the expiry date but instead receive a cash payment. Traders will receive cash after discounting the market price.</p>
<p>I prefer to call the crude oil assets in the MT4: futures-style Second Contract contracts. Naturally, the gold trading in MT4 is in the form of spot Second Contract contracts. The forex traded on the MT4 is also a spot foreign exchange Second Contract contract.</p>
<h2>3. Second Contract (Contracts for difference)</h2>
<p>I can tell you with certainty that all instruments traded on the MT4 platform are <a href="/en-au/ways-to-trade/cfd-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second Contract</a>s, including the currency pairs, <a href="/en-au/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold and silver</a>, commodities, stock indexes, among others.  Spot and physical transactions are closely related, and futures will postpone the time of physical transactions. Second Contract simply eliminate the physical transactions completely allowing investors to trade purely based on price quotations.</p>
<p>The history of Second Contract is not long,  they were originally invented in the London financial markets in the early 1990s with the purpose of further reducing the intermediate costs of transactions, such as stamp duty.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/Others%20folders/ATFX%20Blog%20Image%202020/ATFX-contract-for-difference-cfd.jpg" alt="ATFX-contract-for-difference-cfd" width="1200" /></p>
<p>The biggest advantage associated with Second Contract is the extremely low transaction costs compared to other tradable instruments. Taking currency pairs as an example, traders do not have to pay any handling fees, as long as they can bear the difference (spread) between the buying price and the selling price.</p>
<p>Second-Based Contract Trading represents a  quotation of the corresponding investment product. Whether the underlying investment product is from spot or futures markets, there is no physical delivery of any products. However, if the delivery date of a futures contract arrives, it will be discounted and delivered in cash.</p>
<p>Since the Second Contract market does not have the same restrictions as the spot and futures markets, traders tend to use more leverage with many brokers offering leverage of up to 1:200 on certain instruments.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The spot and futures markets have a long history and are widely accepted and understood by most investors. However,  most people are unaware of their related operating mechanisms. Second Contract are quite different from spot and futures contracts as they offer greater flexibility to investors. Some people have criticised Second-Based Contract Trading because of its short history and the lack of the delivery of physical commodities.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the characteristics of Second Contract imply that it is not suitable for large institutions that value physical guarantees and would like to take delivery of the commodities traded. However, for most retail traders, the physical delivery is not important. To the contrary, it is very necessary to trade small sizes and use high leverage to maximise their gains. Only the Second Contract The market can satisfy the needs of retail traders who do not have the massive funds that institutions have.</p>
<p>Everyone has different needs. The financial markets do not necessarily teach investors what to do, but they provide enough products and options to suit the different needs of each trader. Therefore, the Second Contract market is legitimate and it exists to serve the specific needs of retail traders.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span id="more-30452"></span>In this step by step guide, we’ll cover many topics to help you become the best and most confident trader you can be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">We’ll discuss some of the most common mistakes traders make and what it takes to be a successful trader.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">There are no shortcuts to success, and there is no holy grail. If you commit to developing new skills, you’ll have a great chance to experience success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Who is a trader, and what do they do?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">A trader is anyone that buys and sells products or services, in this instance we’re only talking about financial traders. Those that buy and sell products within the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial markets</a>. These include forex, equity indices, commodities, cryptocurrencies and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The buying process is done through a broker, and normally online for most retail traders. Although there are still some more traditional brokers where transactions and deals are agreed over the phone and in person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Platforms like <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MT4</a> have made access to the financial markets easy for anyone wanting to get involved. Here you’ll buy and sell the instruments and book all your profits (or losses).</p>

</div>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What type of traders are there?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><img decoding="async" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20D%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20How%20to%20become%20a%20trader%20(child%201)/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-become-a-trader-man-image.jpg?quality=low&amp;width=300&amp;name=analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-become-a-trader-man-image.jpg" alt="how to become a trader" width="300" />You can class types of traders by their activity and the time frame they hold positions for, are they passive or active? Passive traders are mostly investors who tend to trade over the longer term. For example; they may take a position in a currency and remain in that position for months or longer. Active traders can be subdivided into various categories, such as scalpers, day traders and swing traders.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Scalpers will hold trades for very short periods of time, sometimes it’s only a matter of seconds or minutes. They generally work off low time frames such as one to five-minute charts.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Day traders won’t carry trades overnight, all positions will be closed before they finish for the day. They tend to use between five-minute time frames up to hourly time frames.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Swing traders will try to ride the swings they see developing on their four hour or daily time frames, and they may hold trades for days or weeks.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What are the benefits of becoming a trader?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The main benefits of trading are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; The potential profitability is unlimited. The sky really is the limit. However, yes you can make a lot of money becoming a trader, on the flip side, you can lose everything you put into it. Ensure you go in with your eyes open and learn about risk management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Flexibility. There are financial markets open at pretty much every hour of every day. This means you can choose to trade whenever you like. You can ensure that it fits around your schedule rather than the other way round.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; You have complete control. You choose:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li>
<h4>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/market-news/stock-market-opening-times-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hours</a> you trade</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>The instruments you trade</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How much money you commit to the market</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How aggressive you are with your buying and selling</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How you manage your risk</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>The strategy you use</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Where you trade from (this could be an office, your bedroom or a sunny beach)</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Do you need qualifications to be a trader?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">No. You don’t need any qualifications to become a trader, and there is no evidence that professional traders succeed more if they have degrees or professional certificates. That said, it is important to learn, and keep learning about the markets, new trading strategies and tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">If you’re diligent, disciplined and dedicated, you&#8217;re more likely to succeed. That’s why we offer all our clients access to our comprehensive <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/education-and-tools/trading-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading education</a> centre.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Is it hard to become a good trader?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Unfortunately there’s no right answer to that question because it comes down to you, the individual. How good a trader you become is based on the same factors you’d apply to becoming good at anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">There’s no guarantee that you’ll become a sub four hour marathon runner but if you dedicate yourself and train hard, you’ll give yourself the best chance to hit that target. The same applies to trading.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What we do know is that successful traders do possess similar qualities, as mentioned above; diligence, discipline and dedication.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to become a successful trader</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">We’ve highlighted three important things you’ll need to become a successful trader.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Education. Education, education, education. This is arguably the most important factor to success. The more you educate yourself, the more you’ll know about what works and what doesn’t when trading. And as the financial markets are an evolving entity, you should evolve with it, make sure you’re up to date with the latest announcements and news.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Practice. As we’ve highlighted above, trading is like anything, with more practice you will become better. With more experience you will be able to make more informed trading decisions. This is a reason why we always recommend that any new traders start on a demo account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Patience. You’ll not enjoy overnight or immediate success as a novice trader. It’ll take time to develop a <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk management</a> plan and a trading strategy. But being patient will stop you making major mistakes early on and increase your chances of longevity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="width: 608px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20D%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20How%20to%20become%20a%20trader%20(child%201)/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-become-a-trader-people-image.jpg?quality=low&amp;width=825&amp;name=analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-become-a-trader-people-image.jpg" alt="how to become a trader" width="608" height="405" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Learn how to trade:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Choose your market and trading strategy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Whilst it is important to decide which markets you want to trade, right at the beginning of your trading career, it doesn’t matter quite so much. At the end of the day, it is still a chart with the price plotted against time, what that represents isn’t vital right away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">First you should learn <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-start-trading-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to start trading</a>, understand the key principles about risk and strategies. Then you need to decide how much time you can set aside to trade. If you work full time, you’re not going to be an active day trader. So, maybe swing trading is where you should start looking, a strategy where you can look at the charts once or twice a week to make your decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Settling on a clear and simple trading strategy, one that works for you and your circumstances, is an important first step. Check out our great beginner <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/day-trading-strategies-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">day trading strategies</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Practice with a demo account</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">A <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-accounts/demo-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo account</a> is ideal to begin your trading venture. Because you use virtual money while you become familiar with the platform and the trading process, you can build your confidence risk free.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Consider the demo as a driving simulator before you get into a real car. There is no risk to you or anyone else while you practice in a simulator. You can hone your skills and make sure you’re 100% ready before getting behind the wheel of a real car.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">So, a few take outs about why you should use a demo first?</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li>
<h4>Familiarise yourself with the platform</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Practice your trading strategy</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Practice your risk management strategy</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Understand how psychology plays a role in trading</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Grow your confidence</h4>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Open a live account and start trading</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Opening a basic <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading account</a> is easy. You’ll need to fill in the required application form and confirm your identity, which is an important security protocol. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to go.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How much you need to start trading</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">To start trading, you just need to provide your own funds to trade. How much you want to start with is down to you, although most brokers will have a minimum deposit amount. If you’re trading through ATFX, we ask that you deposit a minimum of £/€/$500.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Some brokers do request lower amounts however you might find your trading restricted by smaller amounts. For example, if you were to deposit £/€/$100, it would be ok to take a small trade on a single currency pair but will be inadequate to trade multiple currency pairs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What are the risks involved with trading?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">One of the biggest risks involved in trading is losing a lot of money early on. Having a bad experience and giving up trading before you’ve allowed yourself enough time to develop is a typical story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What percentage of traders are successful? All regulated brokers are required to provide this information. You will see a percentage of traders that lose money from that broker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Avoiding becoming one of these statistics is straightforward. As you’re learning how to trade, make sure you only risk money that you can afford to lose. If losing it won’t have a detrimental effect on you or your family’s life, then that amount is probably fine to risk. It’s important you understand <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/why-do-day-traders-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why traders fail</a>, so you can make sure it doesn’t happen to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">If you’re trading to make money to pay bills and you’re undercapitalised you’ll be stressed and make emotional decisions. You’re less likely to stick to your trading plan, and therefore more likely to start hemorrhaging money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Trading should be an exciting and enjoyable activity. You’re developing a new skill and hopefully building another revenue stream for yourself. You won’t do that if you’re sweating on the outcome of every trade because it’s essential.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Gain experience</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">You can only gain experience by trading. First, start trading in a demo environment, then you will need to move to a live account. There are noticeable psychological differences between the two, so make sure you ease yourself into live trading (start small).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">You will need to trade in a manner you’re comfortable with and by risking funds that won’t materially damage your welfare.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">If you’re just starting your trading journey, our “complete guide for beginners” is aimed at you. You’re curious about <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-online-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online trading</a>, you find the idea exciting, and ultimately you believe you have the qualities to become successful.</p>
<p><span id="more-30439"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We’ll provide you with all the necessary tools, </span>educational resources<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> and extensive research that’ll get you started. We want to ensure your eyes are wide open when it comes to trading so that you understand both the risks and opportunities that come with the financial markets. You’ll avoid the pitfalls, and be aware of the steep learning curve you’re about to experience. A good steep learning curve that is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">Before you take the plunge and put your funds to work, there are many aspects of trading to consider. For example, what broker to choose, how much capital is required to open your account and what strategy you’ll use to trade your selected markets. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">You can’t learn everything you need to know at once &#8211; trading is a long-term journey. What you can do, though, is give yourself the best possible start by building the right foundations and begin acquiring valuable knowledge at the outset.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How does trading work?</h2>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;">You start trading by <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening an account</a> with a broker and downloading a trading platform such as <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaTrader 4</a> (MT4). You then deposit money, choose which markets to trade and you’re in the game.<span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="width: 218px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-graph1-image-1-1.webp" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-graph1-image-1-1" width="218" height="156" /></span></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;">Let’s start by discussing what happens when you place an order, or as many of us would call it; “executing a trade.”</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;">You’re buying or selling a financial product, often referred to as a security, an instrument or an asset. You can trade a currency pair such as USD/JPY, a commodity such as <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold</a>, an equity index such as the DOW 30.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;">Click either ‘buy’ or ‘sell’, depending on whether you think the market is going to go up or down. You’ll go long if you think the market price is going up, or short if you think it is going down.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Your order and the cost</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Your order gets routed to the market via your broker, and then gets completed (filled) at the best possible price. The broker will charge you a fee and normally this comes in the form of a spread, otherwise it’ll be a commission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Spreads will change frequently. For example, the cost/spread of a currency pair like EUR/USD will continually change; it could be 0.2 pips, then 0.7 pips, or higher. Why does it change? Keep reading.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Factors affecting the spread</h4>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; font-weight: 300;">&#8211; Sudden spikes in price can cause fluctuations in the spread.</span></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Increased volatility results in increased spreads.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; How active the brokers’ clients are will have an impact. The more active, the tighter the spread.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Time of trade. A more active market will have more participants and cause a lower spread.</p>
<h3 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How leverage and margins work</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Leverage refers to how much of the broker’s money you can use combined with your own. For example; if leverage is 1:20, every £100 you put in, the broker will loan you another £2000. Leverage magnifies both your profits and your losses. Margin refers to how much you need to keep in your account to avoid a “margin call”. Hopefully you won’t encounter this issue but it’s when you don’t have enough money in your account to cover your open positions.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How much money do I need to start trading?</h2>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">In theory, you can begin trading without any money. A <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-accounts/demo-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo account</a> offers virtual money and is a great way to enjoy a live market environment, without financial consequence. Many analysts and experienced traders would recommend this as a starting place as it&#8217;s totally risk-free and great experience. You don’t have to stay on the demo long, only until you feel confident enough to trade real funds.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You’ll need to have a clear grasp of leverage and margin before you begin trading for real, and you can start to explore these boundaries while on the demo.</p>
<h4 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Who makes successful trading debuts?</h4>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">The most successful novice traders are those that are willing to learn and can follow a plan. They park their egos to one side and accept that it’ll take time to become familiar with this new industry.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">If you fail to plan &#8211; you plan to fail. Avoiding the most <a href="/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/why-do-day-traders-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common mistakes</a> will help you make a successful debut in the industry. Developing a trading plan is essential. If you were starting a new business venture, you’d put together a business plan, the same is the case for trading, you need to put a plan together before you start.</p>

Straightaway this will help you: </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li><span style="background-color: white;">Limit losses</span></li>

<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;"><span style="background-color: white;">Putting a plan together will also reduce stress and help prevent emotions from affecting your trading decisions. </span></p>

<h4 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Understanding different trading markets</h4>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">There are lots of different financial markets you can trade. Some of the most popular include forex, equity indices, commodities, cryptocurrencies and individual shares.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Each market is different and has its own characteristics. You can either trade the underlying asset (using gold as an example, you would actually own the gold you buy), or you can trade derivatives of the assets. An example would be <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/ways-to-trade/cfd-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second Contract (contracts for difference)</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="color: #425b76;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; color: #425b76;" href="/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-trade-forex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to trade forex for beginners</a></span></h2>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You trade <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forex</a> (FX) by speculating on which direction a currency pair will move. To use <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/eur-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EUR/USD</a> as an example, the Euro gets classed as the base currency, and the US dollar is the term currency. If you speculate on this currency pair rising, you’re predicting that the Euro is more in demand than the Dollar.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Currency pairs get classed into three groups; majors, minors and exotics. There are four major pairs; EUR/USD, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD/JPY</a>, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gbp-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBP/USD</a> and USD/CHF, although some analysts also class AUD/USD, NZD/USD and USD/CAD as major pairs. Minors are pairs such as EUR/JPY, EUR/GBP and GBP/JPY. Exotics might include pairs that have currencies such as the Swedish Krona or Turkish Lira as the base currencies.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">The best spreads and trading conditions usually occur when trading the majors because these currency pairs are the most liquid (bought and sold the most) and most stable.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to trade indices for beginners</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;">Popular and well known equity (share) </span><span style="font-size: 18px;"><a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indices</a></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"> include the <a href="/en-au/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOW 30</a>, the FTSE 100 and the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 (S&amp;P 500)</a>. These are indexes of the best performing stocks in that country or category. You can speculate on the direction of these markets and take positions in them rather than having to own all the shares that comprise them. You can’t invest directly into an index but you can trade derivatives or invest in funds that mimic the price.</span></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to choose a broker?</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2; font-size: 20px;">Top questions to ask a broker<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="width: 181px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-checklist.webp" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-checklist" width="181" height="68" /></h4>
<h3 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What platform does the broker offer?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Brokers offer different types of platforms. There are the main platforms that allow you to take trades, others that allow you to copy other traders, mobile device platforms and platforms that allow you to manage your account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The main two that allow you to execute your trades are proprietary platforms or third-party platforms. Proprietary platforms belong to the broker whilst third-party (as you’d expect) are developed by an external company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">A great example of a third-party platform is MT4. Experienced traders will often choose to trade through brokers who offer MT4 because they trust the platform.</p>
<div class="article-banner article-banner__dark" style="background-image: url('https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Free-Metatrader-4.webp'); background-size: cover; background-position: center; color: #fff; padding: 20px; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0;">

</div>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What are the typical spreads?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Spreads vary from broker to broker. With forex, you normally look at the most liquid pair to compare the brokers spreads. That’s EURUSD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Spreads on EURUSD can range from as low as 0.0 up to normally around 2.0. If you see a broker say their average is higher than 2 for EURUSD, I’d probably keep looking. It’s also given as an average, which means you will get both higher and lower than that if you consistently trade EURUSD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Spreads on other asset classes will range depending on that asset.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What reputation does the broker have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">This is important. You want a broker whose clients speak highly of it. The same way you wouldn’t buy a car if all the feedback was that the brakes don’t work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">It’s worth scanning various forums to check out the reputation of a broker beforehand. However, you need to be cautious with commercial website rankings, as the owners of these sites often charge to rank a broker, and thus the more the broker pays, the higher the ranking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">An absolute must (in our opinion) should be that the broker is regulated. You don’t have to use a regulated broker, but we, and most others in the industry would highly recommend it. In Australia the OTC Derivatives industry is highly regulated and it is very unlikely that you will find an unregulated broker. If there are any it would not be long before the regulator ASIC would take action against them and close them down.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What is the quality of the broker&#8217;s analysis and research?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Ethical brokers want you to win, and they need you to be successful in order to become successful themselves. This bi-directional feedback loop stimulates their business. They’ll provide a range of tools and widgets to help you make good trading decisions, and they’ll also publish a wide range of educational material on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Reputable brokers also broadcast webinars, hold seminars, have trading academies and publish e-Books to help their clients <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-become-a-trader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become better traders</a>.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">If the broker’s analysis is not up to date, and if they don’t have the structure in place to deliver the aforementioned support, then some alarm bells should ring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What trading tools and widgets does the broker offer?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Whilst this isn’t essential, it is not a bad thing to have an armoury of tools at your disposal. They’re there to improve your trading experience, so the better the choice, the better your options.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Tools such as Autochartist  and <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/education-and-tools/trading-central" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trading Central</a>, matched with an extensive <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/economic-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic calendar</a>, are the types of tools you should look out for.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How does the broker respond to your questions?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You can assess the quality of a broker by how quickly they respond to your queries before you open an account, and afterwards. The after-sales, service and support mechanisms are crucial to your trading journey. Good brokers will provide the right information at the right time, to help you build confidence in your trading strategy.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">If the broker ignores your requests or replies late, or offers you too many choices at the outset, it can cause frustration. A broker that replies with the correct information quickly, will speed up your learning process.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to choose a forex broker?</h2>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You should spend some time surfing the company website, perhaps reading their company <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/about-us/our-vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> mission statement</a> to get a feel for their ethics and standards.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Find a set of criteria you’re looking for in a broker. This might include the <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/type-of-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type of broker</a>, whether it’s regulated, it’s spreads, any number of things, it’s up to you. Do your research until one fulfills all your needs. Use the questions above to help form a judgement.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;"><img decoding="async" style="width: 825px; margin: 10px auto;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-umbrella.webp" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-umbrella" width="825" /></p>
<h3 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Are Forex brokers reliable?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You can only judge the reliability of a broker based on your own experience. You’ll decide their credibility based on how honest you perceive them to be. You’ll see spreads quoted, and very quickly you’ll learn how close your orders get filled at the prices you see quoted.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Regulated brokers offer particular reliability and assurance because you know that the regulatory authorities are there to help protect financial consumers like you.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="color: #0f2c52; font-size: 28px; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">How do I know if a forex broker is regulated?</span></h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Typically if a broker is regulated, they’ll make it very clear that they are. Why wouldn’t they want to promote the fact that they adhere to strict measures to protect you?</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Some brokers will have a regulation page  of their website. Others will have a footer on all their web pages that says who they’re regulated by. Each broker will also have a registration number with the authority it&#8217;s covered by. You can check with the regulatory authority to ensure that the broker you’re interested in is regulated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Which is the best forex broker for beginners?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The online retail forex trading industry is an ever-evolving, competitive field. You can decide which forex brokers are the best for you as a novice by running through a quick checklist.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li style="border: none;">Credibility</li>
<li style="border: none;">Reputation</li>
<li style="border: none;">Reliability</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">And it’s also worth checking out how user-friendly the trading platform is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The best forex brokers for beginners will offer support when you’re opening an account and throughout the early weeks. They’ll provide lots of information to help get you started. The best brokers for novices will have informative eBooks, webinars, articles and guides to help get you started safely and securely. By the way, ATFX offers all this.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What is the best trading platform for beginners?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Begin your trading on a flexible platform that you can adjust as you mature as a trader. Platforms like MetaTrader 4 (MT4) are ideal for this. Simple and user-friendly for beginners but with a host of advanced tools for more experienced traders.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Start by simply using MT4 to buy and sell the market you want. Then slowly add in <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/mt4-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical indicators</a> and before you know it you could be using the expert advisors (EAs) &#8211; these will trade your strategy automatically for you.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Which trading account is best for beginners?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">After the demo trading account (we always recommend beginners start with a demo), the trading account you use will depend on how much capital you have to trade and what sort of tools you want from your account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">With most accounts you can work your way up, as you gain confidence. For example, you could start at the basic level account because you don’t need all the tools yet. But as you gather more experience, you could upgrade to tools that offer slightly more.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What type of account best suits my needs?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">If you’re a novice trader, it’s best to start with the most basic account. Concentrate on becoming familiar with its features and the benefits. You can always upgrade when you progress. It’ll also depend on how much you intend to deposit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Make sure you’re doing what is right for you and your circumstances. Remember, never deposit more than you can afford to lose. If you do, you’ll become too attached to your trades and will struggle to follow your plan.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to open a trading account</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Opening an online trading account is a straightforward process and only takes a few minutes. You fill in an application form, pass a knowledge test on trading Second Contract and you will need to provide a proof of identification and a proof of address. When your account is active, you’ll be notified by the broker, and you can transfer funds and begin trading.</p>
<h3 style="border: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to deposit &amp; withdraw funds in my account?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You can use a variety of methods to transfer funds into your online trading account such as your credit or debit card, bank transfer, or use a variety of E-Wallets.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Each broker is different in the options they offer. Here at ATFX we think it’s important to offer all the options for <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-accounts/deposits-and-withdrawals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deposit and withdrawal</a>. Some methods take minutes, while others like bank transfers can take longer. But your broker will notify you once your funds have cleared and you’re ready to trade.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What is the best trading strategy for beginners?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Keep it simple from the start and don’t overcomplicate things.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">There’s no holy grail, and there’s no magic indicator that results in endless profits. Anything that claims to make you rich overnight is wrong. You’re best concentrating on tight money-management and developing an understanding of risk and probability.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">When it comes to strategies, you’ll need to find what works best for you. Although that might sound like a cop out, you’ll hear time and time again that one strategy works for one person but not another.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">A simple yet effective strategy for beginners is to use support and resistance levels to trade between.
