										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streaming giant </span><b>Netflix (NYSE:NFLX)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will release its latest earnings report after the market closes on Thursday with a key technical level in play. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41780" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NFLX-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NFLX - Daily Chart" width="751" height="592" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NFLX-Daily-Chart.png 751w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NFLX-Daily-Chart-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NFLX &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of NFLX has fallen over the last few days and is testing a big support level which was the resistance from the 2021 high. This is the key level to watch around the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings release</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix continues to be the dominant streaming platform and the company will release its third quarter earnings on Thursday. Subscriber gains are expected to slow down and some analysts are predicting a price hike from the company with a growing trend toward advertising revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its last two quarterly earnings reports, Netflix has warned of a potential dip in subscribers as benefits from its password-sharing crackdown are starting to wane. The net increase in Netflix’s paid memberships for the third quarter is expected to be around 3.5 million, marking a sharp decline from 8.8 million seen at the same time last year, according to estimates from FactSet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has also said that it will start to stop subscriber statistics completely in 2025, signalling a shift in focus from subscriber growth to profit. For its users, this could mean more price increases, more ads, and more live event programming, according to analysts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Investors are likely to need to see evidence of pricing leverage in 2025 to make up for slowing account growth,” wrote Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said that the company will not need to show specific plans for a price hike this quarter, but investors will want to see progress by early next year. The last time the company raised its subscriber prices was in October 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company first debuted an ad-supported subscription plan in 2022, and Wedbush analysts said the company’s advertising efforts could become a primary growth driver in 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The most significant benefit of the ad tier so far is that it limits churn. We think Netflix is positioned to accelerate ad tier revenue contribution into year-end and 2025 as it improves its advertising solutions and targeting, utilises new partnerships, and adds more live events,” they wrote on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also focused more on live event programs and one way Netflix is courting advertisers is via more live event programming with American football games and boxing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix will release its latest earnings on Thursday after the US market closes. On Friday, Traders can expect a test of the recent range.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32321" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NFLX-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NFLX – Daily Chart" width="913" height="576" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NFLX-–-Daily-Chart.png 913w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NFLX-–-Daily-Chart-300x189.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NFLX-–-Daily-Chart-768x485.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NFLX – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFLX has been trading between the $640 and $610.90 levels, and a break of either level will require some follow-through. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dominant streaming service is getting ready to release its first-quarter 2024 earnings. Investors and Wall Street analysts will closely monitor its subscriber growth, advertising tier, and password-sharing crackdown momentum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors will also be watching for commentary on content, including a film division reorganisation under new executive Dan Lin. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been on an upswing in 2024, gaining 30% year-to-date. That was much higher than the 6.7% gains of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management guided first-quarter subscriber growth to be below the seasonally more substantial fourth-quarter gain of 13.1 million but up from the 1.7 million increase recorded a year ago. That will give the stock a buffer for weak numbers and may even allow for an upside surprise. The streaming leader had 260 million subscribers at the end of last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge held his “buy” rating on Netflix in a recent report but raised his price target by $125 to $725. “We raised first-quarter/full-year 2024 subscriber estimates and now expect a paid first-quarter addition of 5.11 million,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analyst added that he will look for updates on the company’s new ad-supported pricing tier. He said that recent research at the firm showed Netflix was the most popular for home viewing, and TikTok viewing was starting to slow. A recent attempt to ban or force a sale of the short video firm may have affected that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders should look for the stock to test the upper or lower bound of the recent trading range and watch for a breakout from a recent tight trading range.</span></p>
