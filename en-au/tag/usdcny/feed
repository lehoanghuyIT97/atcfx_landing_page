<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCNY – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the USDCNY exchange rate has hit a resistance block at 7.328 and there is potential to revert back to the 7.087 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US President Donald Trump has clarified the tariff confusion by announcing export taxes on China, Canada and Mexico. The week ahead could see some exchange rate volatility as all countries have vowed to respond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump told journalists that a levy of 25% on Canadian and Mexican imports and an additional 10% tax on Chinese goods would come into force on Tuesday. Canadian energy firms will face a lower 10% tariff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said his actions were led by a desire to control illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Canada and Mexico said they were preparing their own tariffs on US exports, while China added it would take &#8220;necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China has previously said that there are no winners in a trade war but they have been forced to respond. That is a worry when the economy has been struggling but it is interesting that the USD is lower against the Chinese yuan after the tariff announcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has warned Americans that they can expect “some pain” from tariffs and there are threats to the global economic order. Economists have warned that import taxes by the US and other countries, could lead to price rises on a wide range of products, from cars, wood, and steel to food and alcohol.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42516" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/USDCNY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USDCNY - Daily Chart" width="1125" height="625" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/USDCNY-Daily-Chart.png 1125w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/USDCNY-Daily-Chart-300x167.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/USDCNY-Daily-Chart-1024x569.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/USDCNY-Daily-Chart-768x427.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCNY &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the USDCNY has jumped to resistance at 7.177 and could now look to target the August highs around 7.275.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price of gold</a> fell and the US dollar surged after Donald Trump was elected back to the White House with a resounding win of 276 to 223. Gold fell more than 1.5% as uncertainty over the race was cleared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar also surged more than 1% against the Chinese yuan as traders prepared themselves for a return to tariffs against China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While a stronger dollar and higher yields in a Trump win may be headwinds for gold, this will be balanced with potential safe-haven demand in the event of any trade tensions,” said Jun Rong Yeap, strategist with IG Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are fears that Trumps’ policies could increase the federal deficit and that could increase the risk of inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s a Republican sweep, including not only the Senate but the House of Representatives, “Trump’s ability to increase US government debt and push the deficit up is much greater,” said Marcus Garvey, at Macquarie Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump made tariffs and tax cuts a key part of his election strategy, with a majority of voters saying the economy was the biggest issue in the election. Another important part of his platform was to initiate deregulation in areas from banking to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Markets are basically thinking it&#8217;s pro-growth, even if it comes with higher inflation and higher interest rates,&#8221; said David Bianco, chief investment officer at DWS Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential implementation of tariffs, which Trump has said he will increase by 10% on imports, and 60% on goods from China, will be a key theme for investors in the coming months. A study by Deutsche Bank said Trump’s victory would add about half a percentage point to GDP if tariffs are not implemented. Tariffs could subtract around a quarter of a point from GDP, the study added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are still going to be some question marks as to how aggressive Trump does go with tariffs,&#8221; said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar has risen across the world against other major currencies and the falling yuan could have an impact on China’s monetary policy going forward.</span></p>
