										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Day trading strategies come in all shapes and sizes. There are millions because you can make minor amendments to every strategy and this changes each one slightly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the right one, will come down to you, your preferences and your circumstances. It might depend on how much time you have to dedicate, your experience, confidence and your account size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The common denominator is you, decide what you want and that’ll dictate your trading strategy. This article will show some examples of popular trading strategies to get you started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-30458"></span></p>
<h2>What is day trading?</h2>
<p>Day trading, it does what it says on the tin, it&#8217;s trading during the day and not having open positions at night.</p>
<p><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-start-trading-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To start trading</a>, beginners often lean towards day trading because holding trades overnight can cause havoc with some people&#8217;s nerves. Again, this comes down to the individual, but it’s why you tend to see more experienced traders and investors hold positions for longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Is day trading the same as active trading?</h3>
<p>Day trading is classed as active trading because you’re actively engaging with the market to make a profit.</p>
<p>Active trading is considered to be relatively short-term trading. You’re not investing over the long term; you’re putting a percentage of your funds to work each day to find opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to start day trading?</h2>
<p>1. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open an online trading account</a> and familiarise yourself with the platform</p>
<p>2. Create a day trading strategy</p>
<p>a. Trade setup &#8211; Decide the parameters that dictate the trade direction and where to enter</p>
<p>b. Risk management &#8211; Decide where you place your stop loss and profit taking orders and how much of your account will be at risk per trade</p>
<p>c. Execution &#8211; This is the trigger that will decide that the trade is a go</p>
<p>d. Trade management &#8211; Do you need to manage your stop loss whilst the trade is open (only reduce your stop, never extend it)</p>
<p>3. You’re ready to start day trading</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day trading strategies for beginners</h2>
<p>Now we’re getting to the reason you’re here. To see some examples of day trading strategies.<br />
We’ve selected some of the most popular types of day trading strategies and given a breakdown about how you would take a trade.</p>
<p>They’re perfectly suited for beginners because they’re simple and straightforward to implement. But don’t underestimate the power and relevance of simplicity. Some of the most profitable and proven strategies are often the simplest.</p>
<p>Before we jump into the strategies, you need a risk warning, it’s essential you go into trading with your eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Like all trading strategies, there are no guarantees of success. No method and trading strategy works all the time and has a 100% success rate. You have to recognise that managing your risk is critical and actually having an understanding about <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/why-do-day-traders-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why traders fail</a>, will also serve you well in your education. We also need to remind you that we are an execution only broker, which means we can’t give you advice. The following strategies are only examples, and you should always do your own research before making trading decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Breakout trading strategy</h3>
<p>A breakout trading strategy is identified by price impulsively breaking out from a trading range or channel.</p>
<p>Below is a step by step example of a breakout trading strategy:</p>
<p><strong>Trade set up </strong></p>
<p>1. Identify support and resistance levels. Ensure you find at least two levels above and two levels below the price.</p>
<p>2. Identify the daily trend direction; trade in the same direction of the trend. If the market is creating higher highs and higher lows, only take long positions. If the market is creating lower highs and lower lows, only take short positions.</p>
<p>3. Identify your potential entry and exit (stop loss and profit-taking) levels. This will be done using the levels you have previously identified. If the market is trending higher, place your stop loss below the support level and target the next resistance level.</p>
<p><strong>Risk management </strong></p>
<p>4. Once entry and exit levels are identified, decide how much you will risk on the trade. For example, no more than 1% of your account should be at risk on any one trade. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here for more information about risk management strategies</a>.</p>
<p>5. Consider your total exposure, perhaps no more than 2% of your account gets risked at any one time.</p>
<p><strong>Execution </strong></p>
<p>6. Identify the breakout. When a candle closes with 50% of its body over the support or resistance level, price action has developed.</p>
<p>7. Place the trade with the correct lot size, ensure you place a stop loss and target into the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20E%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Day%20trading%20strategies%20(child%201)/analysis-trading-strategies-day-trading-strategies-graph-image.jpg" alt="day-trading" width="1200" /></p>
<p>You can implement breakout strategies at any time of the day, essentially whenever you get a setup.</p>
<p>If you are day trading with a strategy like this, then you would usually look for trades in the morning to give them time to develop before you call it a day.</p>
<p>London breakout strategies are popular choices. This is where you try to catch the initial breakout of the London trading session. More often than not activity will increase during this time and the idea is that once the direction is decided (the breakout in either direction), you can trade it. Trading this strategy will normally mean your positions are closed by the afternoon or evening.</p>

<h3>Momentum trading strategy</h3>
<p>Momentum trading is taking a trade based on the strength of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, if there are enough buyers buying, there will be enough force behind the movement to keep it going.</p>
<p>Momentum trading strategies rely on volatility and volume. In this example, we will be using the RSI (relative strength index) indicator. Below is the step by step walkthrough of a momentum trading strategy:</p>
<p><strong>Trade set up</strong></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">1. Identify the trend direction. If the market is making higher highs and higher lows, the trend is up. If it’s making lower highs and lower lows, the trend is down. Only trade in the direction of the trend (with the momentum).</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">2. Wait until the RSI enters either the overbought (above 70 level) or oversold (below 30 level) zones, depending on the direction you’re trending. For an uptrend, you want the RSI to be oversold, and vice versa if in a down trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">3. Using an uptrend as an example, if the RSI moves out of the oversold zone, we have our signal to enter the trade, we just need a price action confirmation. </span></p>
<p><strong>Risk management</strong></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">4. Place your stop where the trade would become invalidated. If the market is trending higher, you will have identified the higher highs and higher lows. Place the stop loss below the previous low. If the market goes below that low, the trade is invalid as the market is no longer trending up. It’s in the consolidation phase and has no momentum.  </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">5. Ensure you put no more than 1% of your account size on the trade.</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">6. No target level is placed because we want to stay in the trade for as long as the momentum is there. </span></p>
<p><strong>Execution</strong></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">7. As you have the signal in the trade set up, you now need price action to confirm the direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">8. Wait for a bullish candlestick formation, whereby the candle is larger than recent candles and closes close to the high of the candlestick. </span></p>
<p><strong>Trade management</strong></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">9. Move you stop loss up to below every new low created by this market. You will exit the trade once the market goes from a trending market to a consolidation market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reversal trading strategy</h3>
<p>With reversal strategies, you’re looking for confirmation that the current trend is over and that the new trend is starting.</p>
<p>Below is a step by step example of a reversal trading strategy:</p>
<p><strong>Trade set up</strong></p>
<p>1. Identify the trend direction. If the market is making higher highs and higher lows, the trend is up. If it’s making lower highs and lower lows, the trend is down.</p>
<p>2. Identify support or resistance zones where a reversal could take place. These should be evident by the market having held there in the past.</p>
<p>3. Wait for the market to stall at a resistance level (if the trend is up and you’re looking to sell). If in an uptrend, the market has stopped creating higher highs and higher lows, perfect.</p>
<p>4. Wait for the market to create a lower high. Once this has been created, then your trade is set up.</p>
<p><strong>Risk management</strong></p>
<p>5. Identify your stop loss level. If in an uptrend, this should be above the high of the uptrend.</p>
<p>6. Consider lowering your risk on this strategy because you are trading against the trend.</p>
<p>7. Instead of 1%, a 0.5% risk would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>8. Identify your target level. If in an uptrend, take the distance from highest low to the highest high, then project that below the highest low.</p>
<p><strong>Trade execution</strong></p>
<p>9. Place the trade as soon as the market breaks below the recent low after creating a lower high. This is now the market showing you that it’s in a downtrend because it has created a lower high and a lower low.</p>
<p>This is a traditional reversal strategy whereby you let the market show you the direction before you enter the trade. There are a huge number of reversal strategies, which use a host of different indicators. Some are for a quick reversal whilst others are for more prolonged moves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Scalping trading strategy</h3>
<p>Scalping is a term to define banking a small number of pips or points as profit in a short period. The name initially related to scalping the spread; you’d be looking to capture movements as low as a pip or point inside seconds. But over recent years the term has evolved to include any strategy that gets used to bank small amounts over a short period.</p>
<p>Scalping is a difficult skill because of your critical cost; the spread is continuously changing. Therefore, if you’re aiming for a two pip profit and the spread suddenly widens to two pips, your advantage is lost.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Which trading strategies get used with MT4?</h2>
<p>The <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MT4 platform</a> is perfect to trade any strategies on. It offers all the most popular trading indicators so that you can trade your strategy effectively. On top of that you can also use a vast amount of custom indicators that have been developed by the MT4 community. Any indicator you need for your strategy, you will be able to access it through MT4.</p>
<p>One of the reasons MT4 is so popular is because of its ability to automate trading strategies. Expert advisors (EAs) are programs that take trades based on the criteria you determine. In very simple terms, if A, B and C are all ticked, then it will execute your trade for you.</p>
<p>There is an extensive library of free trading strategies and <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/mt4-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading indicators</a> already built-in to the platform. Applying these to your chart is a simple drag and drop exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Forex trading strategies</h3>
<p><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trading forex</a> is arguably the most popular use of <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical analysis</a> trading strategies.</p>
<p>Reasons why traders like forex trading strategies:</p>
<p>● Liquidity. It’s very easy to enter and exit at the price you want to therefore planning your risk levels are considerably easier.</p>
<p>● 24/5 market. It’s open from Sunday night to Friday night, which means there are ample trading opportunities.</p>
<p>● Low costs. Due to the large volumes and liquidity, you pay some of the lowest spreads when trading the forex market, which means your bottom line is better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Which strategy should you choose?/ Which is right for you?</h2>
<p>All trading strategies will have winning trades and losing trades. You have to be patient and allow any approach to be used over enough time to judge its effectiveness. Some strategies will work for you, and some won’t. Trading is a personal thing, pick what you find works.</p>
<p>You also have to select a trading style, a method and a strategy that fits in with your lifestyle and work-life balance.</p>
<p>So how do you find which one is for you? Here are a couple of pointers to start you off.</p>
<p>● Lots of available time? With more time to dedicate, you could try day trading.</p>
<p>● Not much available time? You could look at the markets once a week and try swing trading.</p>
<p>● Always thinking about the trade? Might be better to stick to day trading and not keep yourself up all night.</p>
<p>● Enjoy analysis? Consider using primary and secondary indicators. You can add oscillators like RSI and MACD to help confirm your trades.</p>
<p>● Which strategy to try first? There are three main strategies; trending, countertrend, and range trading. Maybe look into trend following strategies first.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span id="more-30452"></span>In this step by step guide, we’ll cover many topics to help you become the best and most confident trader you can be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">We’ll discuss some of the most common mistakes traders make and what it takes to be a successful trader.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">There are no shortcuts to success, and there is no holy grail. If you commit to developing new skills, you’ll have a great chance to experience success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Who is a trader, and what do they do?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">A trader is anyone that buys and sells products or services, in this instance we’re only talking about financial traders. Those that buy and sell products within the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial markets</a>. These include forex, equity indices, commodities, cryptocurrencies and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The buying process is done through a broker, and normally online for most retail traders. Although there are still some more traditional brokers where transactions and deals are agreed over the phone and in person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Platforms like <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MT4</a> have made access to the financial markets easy for anyone wanting to get involved. Here you’ll buy and sell the instruments and book all your profits (or losses).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><img decoding="async" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20D%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20How%20to%20become%20a%20trader%20(child%201)/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-become-a-trader-man-image.jpg?quality=low&amp;width=300&amp;name=analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-become-a-trader-man-image.jpg" alt="how to become a trader" width="300" />You can class types of traders by their activity and the time frame they hold positions for, are they passive or active? Passive traders are mostly investors who tend to trade over the longer term. For example; they may take a position in a currency and remain in that position for months or longer. Active traders can be subdivided into various categories, such as scalpers, day traders and swing traders.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Scalpers will hold trades for very short periods of time, sometimes it’s only a matter of seconds or minutes. They generally work off low time frames such as one to five-minute charts.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Day traders won’t carry trades overnight, all positions will be closed before they finish for the day. They tend to use between five-minute time frames up to hourly time frames.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Swing traders will try to ride the swings they see developing on their four hour or daily time frames, and they may hold trades for days or weeks.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What are the benefits of becoming a trader?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The main benefits of trading are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; The potential profitability is unlimited. The sky really is the limit. However, yes you can make a lot of money becoming a trader, on the flip side, you can lose everything you put into it. Ensure you go in with your eyes open and learn about risk management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Flexibility. There are financial markets open at pretty much every hour of every day. This means you can choose to trade whenever you like. You can ensure that it fits around your schedule rather than the other way round.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; You have complete control. You choose:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li>
<h4>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/market-news/stock-market-opening-times-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hours</a> you trade</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>The instruments you trade</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How much money you commit to the market</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How aggressive you are with your buying and selling</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How you manage your risk</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>The strategy you use</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Where you trade from (this could be an office, your bedroom or a sunny beach)</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Do you need qualifications to be a trader?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">No. You don’t need any qualifications to become a trader, and there is no evidence that professional traders succeed more if they have degrees or professional certificates. That said, it is important to learn, and keep learning about the markets, new trading strategies and tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">If you’re diligent, disciplined and dedicated, you&#8217;re more likely to succeed. That’s why we offer all our clients access to our comprehensive <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/education-and-tools/trading-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading education</a> centre.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Is it hard to become a good trader?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Unfortunately there’s no right answer to that question because it comes down to you, the individual. How good a trader you become is based on the same factors you’d apply to becoming good at anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">There’s no guarantee that you’ll become a sub four hour marathon runner but if you dedicate yourself and train hard, you’ll give yourself the best chance to hit that target. The same applies to trading.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What we do know is that successful traders do possess similar qualities, as mentioned above; diligence, discipline and dedication.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to become a successful trader</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">We’ve highlighted three important things you’ll need to become a successful trader.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Education. Education, education, education. This is arguably the most important factor to success. The more you educate yourself, the more you’ll know about what works and what doesn’t when trading. And as the financial markets are an evolving entity, you should evolve with it, make sure you’re up to date with the latest announcements and news.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Practice. As we’ve highlighted above, trading is like anything, with more practice you will become better. With more experience you will be able to make more informed trading decisions. This is a reason why we always recommend that any new traders start on a demo account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Patience. You’ll not enjoy overnight or immediate success as a novice trader. It’ll take time to develop a <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk management</a> plan and a trading strategy. But being patient will stop you making major mistakes early on and increase your chances of longevity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" style="width: 608px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20D%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20How%20to%20become%20a%20trader%20(child%201)/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-become-a-trader-people-image.jpg?quality=low&amp;width=825&amp;name=analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-become-a-trader-people-image.jpg" alt="how to become a trader" width="608" height="405" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Learn how to trade:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Choose your market and trading strategy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Whilst it is important to decide which markets you want to trade, right at the beginning of your trading career, it doesn’t matter quite so much. At the end of the day, it is still a chart with the price plotted against time, what that represents isn’t vital right away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">First you should learn <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-start-trading-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to start trading</a>, understand the key principles about risk and strategies. Then you need to decide how much time you can set aside to trade. If you work full time, you’re not going to be an active day trader. So, maybe swing trading is where you should start looking, a strategy where you can look at the charts once or twice a week to make your decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Settling on a clear and simple trading strategy, one that works for you and your circumstances, is an important first step. Check out our great beginner <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/day-trading-strategies-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">day trading strategies</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Practice with a demo account</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">A <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-accounts/demo-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo account</a> is ideal to begin your trading venture. Because you use virtual money while you become familiar with the platform and the trading process, you can build your confidence risk free.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Consider the demo as a driving simulator before you get into a real car. There is no risk to you or anyone else while you practice in a simulator. You can hone your skills and make sure you’re 100% ready before getting behind the wheel of a real car.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">So, a few take outs about why you should use a demo first?</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li>
<h4>Familiarise yourself with the platform</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Practice your trading strategy</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Practice your risk management strategy</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Understand how psychology plays a role in trading</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Grow your confidence</h4>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Open a live account and start trading</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Opening a basic <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading account</a> is easy. You’ll need to fill in the required application form and confirm your identity, which is an important security protocol. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to go.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How much you need to start trading</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">To start trading, you just need to provide your own funds to trade. How much you want to start with is down to you, although most brokers will have a minimum deposit amount. If you’re trading through ATFX, we ask that you deposit a minimum of £/€/$500.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Some brokers do request lower amounts however you might find your trading restricted by smaller amounts. For example, if you were to deposit £/€/$100, it would be ok to take a small trade on a single currency pair but will be inadequate to trade multiple currency pairs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What are the risks involved with trading?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">One of the biggest risks involved in trading is losing a lot of money early on. Having a bad experience and giving up trading before you’ve allowed yourself enough time to develop is a typical story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What percentage of traders are successful? All regulated brokers are required to provide this information. You will see a percentage of traders that lose money from that broker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Avoiding becoming one of these statistics is straightforward. As you’re learning how to trade, make sure you only risk money that you can afford to lose. If losing it won’t have a detrimental effect on you or your family’s life, then that amount is probably fine to risk. It’s important you understand <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/why-do-day-traders-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why traders fail</a>, so you can make sure it doesn’t happen to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">If you’re trading to make money to pay bills and you’re undercapitalised you’ll be stressed and make emotional decisions. You’re less likely to stick to your trading plan, and therefore more likely to start hemorrhaging money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Trading should be an exciting and enjoyable activity. You’re developing a new skill and hopefully building another revenue stream for yourself. You won’t do that if you’re sweating on the outcome of every trade because it’s essential.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Gain experience</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">You can only gain experience by trading. First, start trading in a demo environment, then you will need to move to a live account. There are noticeable psychological differences between the two, so make sure you ease yourself into live trading (start small).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">You will need to trade in a manner you’re comfortable with and by risking funds that won’t materially damage your welfare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2; font-size: 33px;">How to start trading?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">If you’re just starting your trading journey, our “complete guide for beginners” is aimed at you. You’re curious about <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-online-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online trading</a>, you find the idea exciting, and ultimately you believe you have the qualities to become successful.</p>
<p><span id="more-30439"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We’ll provide you with all the necessary tools, </span>educational resources<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> and extensive research that’ll get you started. We want to ensure your eyes are wide open when it comes to trading so that you understand both the risks and opportunities that come with the financial markets. You’ll avoid the pitfalls, and be aware of the steep learning curve you’re about to experience. A good steep learning curve that is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">Before you take the plunge and put your funds to work, there are many aspects of trading to consider. For example, what broker to choose, how much capital is required to open your account and what strategy you’ll use to trade your selected markets. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">You can’t learn everything you need to know at once &#8211; trading is a long-term journey. What you can do, though, is give yourself the best possible start by building the right foundations and begin acquiring valuable knowledge at the outset.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How does trading work?</h2>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;">You start trading by <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening an account</a> with a broker and downloading a trading platform such as <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaTrader 4</a> (MT4). You then deposit money, choose which markets to trade and you’re in the game.<span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;"><img decoding="async" style="width: 218px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-graph1-image-1-1.webp" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-graph1-image-1-1" width="218" height="156" /></span></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;">Let’s start by discussing what happens when you place an order, or as many of us would call it; “executing a trade.”</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;">You’re buying or selling a financial product, often referred to as a security, an instrument or an asset. You can trade a currency pair such as USD/JPY, a commodity such as <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold</a>, an equity index such as the DOW 30.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;">Click either ‘buy’ or ‘sell’, depending on whether you think the market is going to go up or down. You’ll go long if you think the market price is going up, or short if you think it is going down.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Your order and the cost</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Your order gets routed to the market via your broker, and then gets completed (filled) at the best possible price. The broker will charge you a fee and normally this comes in the form of a spread, otherwise it’ll be a commission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Spreads will change frequently. For example, the cost/spread of a currency pair like EUR/USD will continually change; it could be 0.2 pips, then 0.7 pips, or higher. Why does it change? Keep reading.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Factors affecting the spread</h4>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; font-weight: 300;">&#8211; Sudden spikes in price can cause fluctuations in the spread.</span></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Increased volatility results in increased spreads.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; How active the brokers’ clients are will have an impact. The more active, the tighter the spread.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">&#8211; Time of trade. A more active market will have more participants and cause a lower spread.</p>
<h3 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How leverage and margins work</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Leverage refers to how much of the broker’s money you can use combined with your own. For example; if leverage is 1:20, every £100 you put in, the broker will loan you another £2000. Leverage magnifies both your profits and your losses. Margin refers to how much you need to keep in your account to avoid a “margin call”. Hopefully you won’t encounter this issue but it’s when you don’t have enough money in your account to cover your open positions.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How much money do I need to start trading?</h2>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">In theory, you can begin trading without any money. A <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-accounts/demo-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo account</a> offers virtual money and is a great way to enjoy a live market environment, without financial consequence. Many analysts and experienced traders would recommend this as a starting place as it&#8217;s totally risk-free and great experience. You don’t have to stay on the demo long, only until you feel confident enough to trade real funds.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You’ll need to have a clear grasp of leverage and margin before you begin trading for real, and you can start to explore these boundaries while on the demo.</p>
<h4 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Who makes successful trading debuts?</h4>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">The most successful novice traders are those that are willing to learn and can follow a plan. They park their egos to one side and accept that it’ll take time to become familiar with this new industry.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">If you fail to plan &#8211; you plan to fail. Avoiding the most <a href="/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/why-do-day-traders-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common mistakes</a> will help you make a successful debut in the industry. Developing a trading plan is essential. If you were starting a new business venture, you’d put together a business plan, the same is the case for trading, you need to put a plan together before you start.</p>

Straightaway this will help you: </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li><span style="background-color: white;">Limit losses</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: white;">Prevent you from over-trading</span></li>

<h4 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Understanding different trading markets</h4>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">There are lots of different financial markets you can trade. Some of the most popular include forex, equity indices, commodities, cryptocurrencies and individual shares.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Each market is different and has its own characteristics. You can either trade the underlying asset (using gold as an example, you would actually own the gold you buy), or you can trade derivatives of the assets. An example would be <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/ways-to-trade/cfd-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second Contract (contracts for difference)</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="color: #425b76;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; color: #425b76;" href="/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-trade-forex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to trade forex for beginners</a></span></h2>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You trade <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forex</a> (FX) by speculating on which direction a currency pair will move. To use <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/eur-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EUR/USD</a> as an example, the Euro gets classed as the base currency, and the US dollar is the term currency. If you speculate on this currency pair rising, you’re predicting that the Euro is more in demand than the Dollar.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Currency pairs get classed into three groups; majors, minors and exotics. There are four major pairs; EUR/USD, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD/JPY</a>, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gbp-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBP/USD</a> and USD/CHF, although some analysts also class AUD/USD, NZD/USD and USD/CAD as major pairs. Minors are pairs such as EUR/JPY, EUR/GBP and GBP/JPY. Exotics might include pairs that have currencies such as the Swedish Krona or Turkish Lira as the base currencies.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">The best spreads and trading conditions usually occur when trading the majors because these currency pairs are the most liquid (bought and sold the most) and most stable.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to trade indices for beginners</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 2;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;">Popular and well known equity (share) </span><span style="font-size: 18px;"><a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indices</a></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"> include the <a href="/en-au/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOW 30</a>, the FTSE 100 and the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 (S&amp;P 500)</a>. These are indexes of the best performing stocks in that country or category. You can speculate on the direction of these markets and take positions in them rather than having to own all the shares that comprise them. You can’t invest directly into an index but you can trade derivatives or invest in funds that mimic the price.</span></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to choose a broker?</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2; font-size: 20px;">Top questions to ask a broker<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="width: 181px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-checklist.webp" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-checklist" width="181" height="68" /></h4>
<h3 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What platform does the broker offer?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Brokers offer different types of platforms. There are the main platforms that allow you to take trades, others that allow you to copy other traders, mobile device platforms and platforms that allow you to manage your account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The main two that allow you to execute your trades are proprietary platforms or third-party platforms. Proprietary platforms belong to the broker whilst third-party (as you’d expect) are developed by an external company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">A great example of a third-party platform is MT4. Experienced traders will often choose to trade through brokers who offer MT4 because they trust the platform.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What are the typical spreads?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Spreads vary from broker to broker. With forex, you normally look at the most liquid pair to compare the brokers spreads. That’s EURUSD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Spreads on EURUSD can range from as low as 0.0 up to normally around 2.0. If you see a broker say their average is higher than 2 for EURUSD, I’d probably keep looking. It’s also given as an average, which means you will get both higher and lower than that if you consistently trade EURUSD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Spreads on other asset classes will range depending on that asset.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What reputation does the broker have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">This is important. You want a broker whose clients speak highly of it. The same way you wouldn’t buy a car if all the feedback was that the brakes don’t work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">It’s worth scanning various forums to check out the reputation of a broker beforehand. However, you need to be cautious with commercial website rankings, as the owners of these sites often charge to rank a broker, and thus the more the broker pays, the higher the ranking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">An absolute must (in our opinion) should be that the broker is regulated. You don’t have to use a regulated broker, but we, and most others in the industry would highly recommend it. In Australia the OTC Derivatives industry is highly regulated and it is very unlikely that you will find an unregulated broker. If there are any it would not be long before the regulator ASIC would take action against them and close them down.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What is the quality of the broker&#8217;s analysis and research?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Ethical brokers want you to win, and they need you to be successful in order to become successful themselves. This bi-directional feedback loop stimulates their business. They’ll provide a range of tools and widgets to help you make good trading decisions, and they’ll also publish a wide range of educational material on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Reputable brokers also broadcast webinars, hold seminars, have trading academies and publish e-Books to help their clients <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-become-a-trader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become better traders</a>.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">If the broker’s analysis is not up to date, and if they don’t have the structure in place to deliver the aforementioned support, then some alarm bells should ring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What trading tools and widgets does the broker offer?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Whilst this isn’t essential, it is not a bad thing to have an armoury of tools at your disposal. They’re there to improve your trading experience, so the better the choice, the better your options.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Tools such as Autochartist  and <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/education-and-tools/trading-central" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trading Central</a>, matched with an extensive <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/economic-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic calendar</a>, are the types of tools you should look out for.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How does the broker respond to your questions?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You can assess the quality of a broker by how quickly they respond to your queries before you open an account, and afterwards. The after-sales, service and support mechanisms are crucial to your trading journey. Good brokers will provide the right information at the right time, to help you build confidence in your trading strategy.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">If the broker ignores your requests or replies late, or offers you too many choices at the outset, it can cause frustration. A broker that replies with the correct information quickly, will speed up your learning process.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to choose a forex broker?</h2>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You should spend some time surfing the company website, perhaps reading their company <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/about-us/our-vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> mission statement</a> to get a feel for their ethics and standards.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Find a set of criteria you’re looking for in a broker. This might include the <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/type-of-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type of broker</a>, whether it’s regulated, it’s spreads, any number of things, it’s up to you. Do your research until one fulfills all your needs. Use the questions above to help form a judgement.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;"><img decoding="async" style="width: 825px; margin: 10px auto;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-umbrella.webp" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-how-to-start-umbrella" width="825" /></p>
<h3 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Are Forex brokers reliable?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You can only judge the reliability of a broker based on your own experience. You’ll decide their credibility based on how honest you perceive them to be. You’ll see spreads quoted, and very quickly you’ll learn how close your orders get filled at the prices you see quoted.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Regulated brokers offer particular reliability and assurance because you know that the regulatory authorities are there to help protect financial consumers like you.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><span style="color: #0f2c52; font-size: 28px; letter-spacing: 0px; text-transform: initial; background-color: transparent;">How do I know if a forex broker is regulated?</span></h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Typically if a broker is regulated, they’ll make it very clear that they are. Why wouldn’t they want to promote the fact that they adhere to strict measures to protect you?</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Some brokers will have a regulation page  of their website. Others will have a footer on all their web pages that says who they’re regulated by. Each broker will also have a registration number with the authority it&#8217;s covered by. You can check with the regulatory authority to ensure that the broker you’re interested in is regulated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Which is the best forex broker for beginners?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The online retail forex trading industry is an ever-evolving, competitive field. You can decide which forex brokers are the best for you as a novice by running through a quick checklist.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
<li style="border: none;">Credibility</li>
<li style="border: none;">Reputation</li>
<li style="border: none;">Reliability</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">And it’s also worth checking out how user-friendly the trading platform is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The best forex brokers for beginners will offer support when you’re opening an account and throughout the early weeks. They’ll provide lots of information to help get you started. The best brokers for novices will have informative eBooks, webinars, articles and guides to help get you started safely and securely. By the way, ATFX offers all this.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What is the best trading platform for beginners?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Begin your trading on a flexible platform that you can adjust as you mature as a trader. Platforms like MetaTrader 4 (MT4) are ideal for this. Simple and user-friendly for beginners but with a host of advanced tools for more experienced traders.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Start by simply using MT4 to buy and sell the market you want. Then slowly add in <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/mt4-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical indicators</a> and before you know it you could be using the expert advisors (EAs) &#8211; these will trade your strategy automatically for you.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Which trading account is best for beginners?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">After the demo trading account (we always recommend beginners start with a demo), the trading account you use will depend on how much capital you have to trade and what sort of tools you want from your account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">With most accounts you can work your way up, as you gain confidence. For example, you could start at the basic level account because you don’t need all the tools yet. But as you gather more experience, you could upgrade to tools that offer slightly more.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What type of account best suits my needs?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">If you’re a novice trader, it’s best to start with the most basic account. Concentrate on becoming familiar with its features and the benefits. You can always upgrade when you progress. It’ll also depend on how much you intend to deposit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Make sure you’re doing what is right for you and your circumstances. Remember, never deposit more than you can afford to lose. If you do, you’ll become too attached to your trades and will struggle to follow your plan.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to open a trading account</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Opening an online trading account is a straightforward process and only takes a few minutes. You fill in an application form, pass a knowledge test on trading Second Contract and you will need to provide a proof of identification and a proof of address. When your account is active, you’ll be notified by the broker, and you can transfer funds and begin trading.</p>
<h3 style="border: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How to deposit &amp; withdraw funds in my account?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">You can use a variety of methods to transfer funds into your online trading account such as your credit or debit card, bank transfer, or use a variety of E-Wallets.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Each broker is different in the options they offer. Here at ATFX we think it’s important to offer all the options for <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-accounts/deposits-and-withdrawals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deposit and withdrawal</a>. Some methods take minutes, while others like bank transfers can take longer. But your broker will notify you once your funds have cleared and you’re ready to trade.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What is the best trading strategy for beginners?</h3>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">Keep it simple from the start and don’t overcomplicate things.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">There’s no holy grail, and there’s no magic indicator that results in endless profits. Anything that claims to make you rich overnight is wrong. You’re best concentrating on tight money-management and developing an understanding of risk and probability.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">When it comes to strategies, you’ll need to find what works best for you. Although that might sound like a cop out, you’ll hear time and time again that one strategy works for one person but not another.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 300; margin: 0px 0px 15px; line-height: 2;">A simple yet effective strategy for beginners is to use support and resistance levels to trade between. See our page for great beginner <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #f2672a; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/day-trading-strategies-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading strategies</a>.</p>
<h5 style="border: none; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 2; font-size: 20px;">Are you ready to start trading?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">This brief guide is a simple step-by-step introduction, helping you understand what’s involved in the early stages. We think we’ve covered most bases; from how to evaluate the quality of brokers, opening your account, how to transfer funds, and how to build a basic trading strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">This should give you an idea about how to get started in trading. We don’t suggest you dive straight into a live account yet. Test the water on a demo first. If you’re a beginner and eager to get started, speak to one of our dedicated support team to give you a bit more information. We have a live chat service on the website, or you could call us and have a relaxed chat with one of our specialists.</p>
