<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44160" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US-30-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="US 30 – Daily Chart" width="925" height="586" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US-30-–-Daily-Chart.png 925w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US-30-–-Daily-Chart-300x190.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US-30-–-Daily-Chart-768x487.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">US 30 – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US 30 saw its largest consecutive run of daily losses in years last week and a sharp selloff has led to a bounce back to test 42,000. The next two weeks will be important to see if stocks can end the year, or start 2025, in weakness or in strength. Further support below is at the 41,381 and 40,000 levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US industrial index can be an indicator of foreign investor appetite for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many overseas investors want to own the trophy stocks in the 30-strong index.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest moves could highlight fears that overseas investors have with the Donald Trump administration. Volatility in the US dollar may have also created some negative sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks rebounded on Friday after a dovish US PCE report, while the threat of a government shutdown also receded. Investors felt that Wednesday&#8217;s post-FOMC meeting selling may have been overdone. Fed Chair Jerome Powell disappointed markets by saying that the central bank would cut rates only twice in 2025, after signalling four cuts previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks were hurt by the threat of a government shutdown at midnight Friday if Congress could pass a stop-gap funding bill. It was also a worrying sign that a Republican-controlled House could not pass the Trump-approved funding bill Thursday. That could highlight further political impasse in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any extended government shutdown would have negative consequences for US economic growth. Further stock losses came on Trump&#8217;s threat on Friday to hit the EU with tariffs if it doesn&#8217;t engage in large purchases of US oil and gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The threat of tariffs has been louder since the election and may be why overseas investors are selling stocks in the Dow Jones index.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday&#8217;s weaker-than-expected PCE inflation report, which saw November prices rising by +0.1% m/m and +2.4% y/y, does help to put a little pressure on the Fed’s plans.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">US 30 &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of US 30 has surged to a new all-time high above the 43,500 level. The previous high around 43,325 will provide support for the latest breakout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Index</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a key winner on the day with gains of more than 3% as investors see Trump’s policies being supportive of industrial and manufacturing firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s clarity: We’re not going to see another January 6th event. The market is breathing a huge sigh of relief on that,” said Michael Block, coo at AgentSmyth. “The mainstream consensus was that we weren’t going to know. And we know”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is this huge perception of a business friendly, tax-friendly regime coming into place, especially with them winning the Senate,” said Block.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JPMorgan analysts wrote in a report ahead of the election result that stocks could gain through the end of 2024. However, “the uncertainty around policy execution would become more prominent in 2025”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was a market coiled for an extreme reaction one way or the other,” said Art Hogan at B Riley Wealth Management. “The market is saying: We just elected a business-friendly president. … The initial reaction to a Trump administration is met with enthusiasm that may be temporary”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has grown an average of 10% under Democrats and 6.7% under Trump’s Republicans, according to CFRA Research. GDP in the US has also underperformed at 2.4% versus 3.0% they added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After testing a new all-time high two weeks ago, the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dow Jones Industrial Average</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has seen its price collapse. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">DJI – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US 30 index tested a previous gap higher from early May, and the 2024 open is 37,560. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US stocks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fell Thursday after software giant </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/market-news/salesforce-release-earnings-on-wednesday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued disappointing guidance and lower revenue, hurting other software names. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 1%, while the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Nasdaq Composite dropped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce shares plunged 20% after the cloud-based software company reported its first quarterly revenue miss in 18 years and offered a soft sales outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weak bookings in Q1 further tested investor patience as the GenAI (generative AI) innovation cycle has yet to inflect top-line results and increasingly becomes a competitive concern,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a risk of a more significant correction with PCE deflator data on Friday, which could add to fears of &#8220;higher rates for longer&#8221; in the United States. Volatility in US stocks on Thursday also affected data feeds, with the CME exchange announcing a data freeze that lasted for about an hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Healthcare was another drag on the Dow Jones after the company&#8217;s CEO discussed Medicare delays at a health conference on Wednesday. UNH stock is down around 4% in the last 2 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFRA analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo that the Salesforce dump was an &#8220;overreaction. &#8220;Although some areas were disappointing, the company still saw growth of 11% during the quarter. He also believes a recovery could happen due to the company&#8217;s &#8220;recurring revenue nature.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US stock futures fell on Friday evening as profit-taking in the technology sector, particularly in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), led to declines on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The focus turned to the upcoming critical inflation data, with the consumer price index (CPI) data due on Tuesday.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dow Jones Daily chart</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> fell 0.7%, the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASDAQ</a> Composite fell 1.2%, and the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/dow-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> closed 0.2% lower.</p>
<p>The market was awaiting the CPI data for more cues on the path of US interest rates and the economy, with expectations of some easing in inflation after the past two months’ outsized CPI readings. However, the core figure was still likely to remain above the Fed’s annual 2% target.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other central bank officials had signalled last week that they were seeking more signs that inflation was weakening before considering cutting interest rates.</p>
