										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starbucks stock slumped after its recent earnings release, and the coffee chain is facing a potential price war in one of its largest markets. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35023" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="SBUX – Daily Chart" width="919" height="613" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 919w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SBUX – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBUX shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trade at the $77.17 level, with solid support at the $68.50 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report from Reuters, the iconic Seattle coffee brand is facing a tough test in China, its second-largest market. Despite previous efforts to avoid a price war, the company will compete with low-cost rivals like Luckin Coffee. The shift in strategy comes after Starbucks&#8217; sales in China have declined, resulting in a rise in offers and discount coupons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are not interested in entering the price war,&#8221; Starbucks&#8217; China CEO Belinda Wong said in January. We focus on capturing high-quality but profitable, sustainable growth.&#8221; CEO Howard Schultz repeated a similar tone during his visit to China in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, analysts, Reuters checks, and social media posts show increased price discounts on Starbucks&#8217; programs, Douyin, and third-party delivery platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move comes after a recent earnings release that showed slow performance. For the second quarter of 2024, Starbucks reported an 11% drop in same-store sales in China. This decline also saw management revise its guidance lower for annual sales. With Chinese customers becoming more cost-conscious, the economic backdrop was another factor in the slowdown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent struggles, Starbucks remains a significant player in the global coffee market. Its current footprint is around 39,000 stores worldwide, with a substantial focus on the United States and China. However, the company has also had recent run-ins with unions for better pay and conditions, and there have been store boycotts over the company&#8217;s Israel stance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schultz has called on the company to return its focus to a better customer experience, particularly in the US. Valuation concerns have also been an issue for investors. The company rebounded well from pandemic store closures. However, investors were slow to price in the Chinese economic slowdown and other issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On inside transactions, Chief Financial Officer Rachel Ruggeri recently sold 3,750 company shares at </span><b>$80 per share</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, highlighted in a recent SEC filing. Ruggeri still owns 65,431 shares of Starbucks but has been reducing her stake over the last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent woes, value investors may start looking at China&#8217;s recent stimulus and economic bounce as a catalyst for improvement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starbucks shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slumped due to weaker earnings, as the former CEO advised management to focus on coffee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32877" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="SBUX – Daily Chart" width="910" height="633" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart.png 910w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-300x209.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SBUX-–-Daily-Chart-768x534.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">SBUX – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of SBUX slumped to $72.90, with support ahead at $68.50. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz returned to the firm months ago and left again. However, he&#8217;s still offering critiques of the company he ran for 25 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Starbucks&#8217; latest weak earnings release, Schultz, a key figure in the company&#8217;s history, shared his insights on his LinkedIn account. He was asked by &#8220;people inside and outside the company&#8221; about his thoughts that the chain&#8217;s US operations are the &#8220;primary reason for the company&#8217;s fall from grace&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores,&#8221; Schultz wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schulz said the app should &#8220;reinvent&#8221; its mobile ordering and payment to &#8220;once again make it the uplifting experience it was designed to be.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schultz said in his letter that he &#8220;experienced some quarters of financial disappointment&#8221; during his tenure but added that &#8220;there must be contrition and renewed focus and discipline on the core&#8221; business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even global giants like McDonald&#8217;s are not immune to market challenges. The fast food chain was also struggling with sales hit by &#8216;the ongoing war in the Middle East&#8217; at restaurants in that part of the world. The effect outweighed sales increases in Japan, Europe, and Latin America. CEO Ian Borden&#8217;s comments on the company&#8217;s first-quarter earnings call underline the negative effect on its reputation in certain parts of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The significant drop in the stock price this week is a clear indicator of potential further losses to come, a fact that investors and financial analysts should be mindful of.</span></p>
