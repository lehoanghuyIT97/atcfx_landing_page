										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions in an asset. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is commonly used to spot potential reversal points, confirm market trend strength, and assess the overall direction of market trends, especially when paired with </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/support-resistance-indicator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support and resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in 1978, RSI has become one of the most widely used technical indicators across markets—including stocks, </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, crypto, and </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commodities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By mastering RSI trading signals, traders can enhance their timing, improve decision-making, and increase profitability. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore how RSI works and how to use it effectively to strengthen your trading strategy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is RSI Formula Calculated?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is calculated by comparing the average gains and losses over a specific period, typically 14 days. It helps traders to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9ee.png" alt="🧮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI Formula: </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI = 100 − [100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss))]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking It Down:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average Gain: The average of price increases over the defined period.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average Loss: The average of price declines over the same period.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-48333" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-is-RSI-Formula-Calculated-1024x529.webp" alt="How-is-RSI-Formula-Calculated" width="800" height="413" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-is-RSI-Formula-Calculated-1024x529.webp 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-is-RSI-Formula-Calculated-300x155.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-is-RSI-Formula-Calculated-768x397.webp 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-is-RSI-Formula-Calculated.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RSI calculation helps traders assess whether an asset is trending up or down by comparing the magnitude of upward price movements to downward price movements.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/23f1.png" alt="⏱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Adjusting RSI Periods Based on Market Conditions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The default RSI setting of 14 periods is widely used because it balances responsiveness and smoothness. However, traders often adjust the period to match their trading market better.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorter periods (example 7-9) for RSI become more sensitive to price changes, giving quicker signals. This is typically used in volatile markets where rapid price fluctuations occur. The disadvantage is that it can lead to more false signals reacting to minor fluctuations, and traders may enter and exit trades too frequently.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer periods (example 21-30) for RSI become less reactive, smoothing out short-term noise. Long-term traders or investors often use this setting to focus on significant market trends such as commodities. The disadvantage is that RSI may be slower in reacting to price changes, meaning that traders may miss out on early trend shifts or reversals.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How RSI Works in Trading</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI determines if an asset is overbought or oversold, signalling potential reversals. By measuring the momentum of price changes, the RSI provides insights into the strength or weakness of an asset’s price movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indicator moves from 0 to 100, with key levels at 70 (overbought) and 30 (oversold).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> RSI Overbought Condition (Above 70):</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When RSI exceeds 70, it suggests that the asset is overbought, and a pullback or reversal may be imminent. This can often coincide with price reaching resistance levels.</span></p>
<p><b><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4cc.png" alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action: Traders often sell when the RSI exceeds 70, anticipating a market correction near resistance.</b></p>
<p><b>Example</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/eur-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EUR/USD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pair has an RSI of 80, it may indicate an overbought market, signalling a potential price decline as the price approaches resistance.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48331" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EUR-USD.webp" alt="EUR-USD" width="755" height="659" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EUR-USD.webp 755w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EUR-USD-300x262.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4c9.png" alt="📉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> RSI Oversold Condition (Below 30):</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When RSI drops below 30, it suggests the asset is oversold, and a price rebound may be on the horizon, especially when approaching support levels.</span></p>
<p><b><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4cc.png" alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </b><b>Action: Traders often look for buying opportunities when RSI is below 30, anticipating a reversal at support.</b></p>
<p><b>Example</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/live-chart/gbp-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBP/USD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pair has an RSI of 25, it could mean the British pound is oversold and may be due for a reversal, potentially bouncing off a key support level.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48332" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GBP-USD.webp" alt="GBP-USD" width="819" height="713" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GBP-USD.webp 819w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GBP-USD-300x261.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GBP-USD-768x669.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI Divergence: Spotting Trend Reversals</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI divergence occurs when the price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of the RSI. This is a key signal for potential trend reversals:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f504.png" alt="🔄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullish Divergence</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occurs when the price makes lower lows, but the RSI forms higher lows. This suggests that selling momentum is weakening and that a price reversal to the upside may happen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Example</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If USD/CAD makes a new low, but the RSI forms a higher low, a buy signal may appear.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48335" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USD-CAD.webp" alt="USD-CAD" width="818" height="708" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USD-CAD.webp 818w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USD-CAD-300x260.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USD-CAD-768x665.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f504.png" alt="🔄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bearish Divergence</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the price makes higher highs but the RSI fails to make new highs, it suggests a weakening of buying momentum and a possible downward reversal.</span></p>
<p><b>Example</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If USD/CHF makes new highs but RSI shows lower highs, it signals a sell signal.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48329" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USD-CHF.webp" alt="USD-CHF" width="887" height="551" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USD-CHF.webp 887w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USD-CHF-300x186.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USD-CHF-768x477.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI Centerline Crossovers: Identifying Trend Strength</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RSI centerline (50 levels) is critical for confirming the strength of an existing trend:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI Above 50: When RSI remains above the 50 level during an uptrend, it signals strong bullish momentum, confirming that the price will likely continue moving upward.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI Below 50: When RSI remains below the 50 level during a downtrend, it indicates strong bearish momentum, suggesting that the downtrend is likely to persist.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crossovers at the 50 level provide additional confirmation of a trend&#8217;s strength. For instance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If RSI crosses above 50 from below, it can signal the start of an uptrend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if RSI crosses below 50 from above, it may signal the beginning of a downtrend.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48334" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RSI-50-uptrend.webp" alt="RSI-50 uptrend" width="886" height="545" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RSI-50-uptrend.webp 886w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RSI-50-uptrend-300x185.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RSI-50-uptrend-768x472.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI Trading Strategies and How to Use It in Your Strategy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI trading is most effective when combined with other technical indicators, trend analysis, or market conditions. Below are some strategies for using RSI:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4cc.png" alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Identify Overbought/Oversold Conditions:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the RSI to detect when an asset is overbought or oversold. Buy when the RSI is below 30 (oversold) and sell when the RSI is above 70 (overbought).</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI above 70 = overbought = potential sell.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI below 30 = oversold = potential buy.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f511.png" alt="🔑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot Divergence for Trend Reversals:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for divergence between price action and RSI to spot weakening trends and predict potential reversals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullish Divergence: Price makes lower lows, RSI makes higher lows. </span><b>Buy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bearish Divergence: Price makes higher highs, RSI makes lower highs. </span><b>Sell</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Confirm Trend Strength:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use RSI to confirm the strength of an ongoing trend. RSI readings above 50 confirm bullish momentum, while readings below 50 confirm bearish momentum.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI &gt; 50: Indicates a strong uptrend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI &lt; 50: Indicates a strong downtrend.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4dd.png" alt="📝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centerline Crossovers:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50 level of RSI is critical for confirming the direction and strength of the trend. Use it to gauge potential buy or sell signals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crossing above 50: Potential uptrend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crossing below 50: Potential downtrend.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best RSI Settings for Different Markets</span></h2>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSI Trading Strategy Tips</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combine RSI with Other Indicators: Use RSI in trading alongside other technical indicators like moving averages or MACD to increase the effectiveness of your strategies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch for Extreme RSI Readings: Look for situations where the RSI exceeds extreme levels (above 70 or below 30), as these can indicate potential reversal points.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use RSI with Trend Analysis: If the market is in a strong trend, RSI can be used to identify pullbacks in the trend, offering more favorable entry points.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">There are a lot of calculations involved in foreign exchange transactions, and understanding how the calculations work can help traders have a comprehensive understanding of how to control risks. Many beginners pay too much attention to technical analysis and ignore the calculation of margin and profit and loss figures. They simply rely on the calculation results that are generated by the MT4 forex trading platform, which is not a good trading habit.</p>
<p><span id="more-30448"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">For example, if we need to trade the EURUSD currency pair and there are 1,000 US dollars in the trading account, and the preset stop loss is 10 points. How many lots can we trade?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">If you are not familiar with the calculation of margin, you can&#8217;t know what you have in mind, and naturally, you can&#8217;t do risk control well.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KfkcIZshEnU?si=83X8NYZp3k8i2Lmc&amp;controls=0&amp;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">1. The first-hand transaction order in the foreign exchange market represents the 10W base currency</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">There are two currencies for each currency pair. The base currency is ranked first, and the denomination currency is ranked behind. For example, among USDJPY, USD is the base currency and JPY is the denomination currency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">If USD is at the front, it is a reverse currency (the full text is represented by USDJPY); if USD is at the back, it is a forward currency (the full text is represented by EURUSD).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">The foreign exchange market stipulates that the total value of a transaction order is 100,000 base currency, where the base currency is the currency in front of the currency pair. Many <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-become-a-trader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beginner traders</a> are accustomed to say that a transaction order is 100,000 US dollars, which is a very obvious mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">For USDJPY, USDCAD, and USDCHF, it is indeed 100,000 U.S. dollars; but for EURUSD, GBPUSD, and AUDUSD, the one-lot transaction orders are 100,000 Euros, 100,000 British pounds, and 100,000 Australian dollars, respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">As we all know, forex can place not only standard lot orders but also 0.1 (mini lot) and 0.01 (micro lot) lot orders. This is a function that other markets do not have.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">When the order volume is 0.1 lot, the total value of the contract is 10,000 base currency. Note that this is the base currency, not the U.S. dollar. When the order volume is 0.01 lots, the total value of the contract is 1,000 base currency. Orders with other values ​​can be obtained by simple multiplication and division operations.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">2. There are two modes of margin floating and fixed</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">The floating margin model is the most mainstream, and it is also the most scientific calculation method. Take 200 times leverage as an example. When trading USDJPY, if the order size is 1 standard lot, then divide the base currency of 100,000 (here, USD) by 200 (here, leverage) to get the total amount of occupied margin as 500 basis Currency (here, USD).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">With the same leverage of 200 times, if the trading product is EURUSD and the order volume is 1 standard lot, then divide the base currency of 100,000 (here: Euro) by 200 (here, leverage) to get the total amount of the occupied margin as 500 base currency (Here in Euros).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">The calculation is not over yet. You must know that the funds in our <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/download-mt4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MT4 account</a> are US dollars, so we need to convert 500 euros to US dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">Assuming that the current EURUSD exchange rate is 1.2, the calculation method is to multiply the total euro margin of 500 by the current exchange rate of 1.2 to obtain the USD margin of 600. In addition to floating margin, there is also a non-mainstream fixed margin model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">As the name implies, the amount of fixed margin remains unchanged for a period of time. This is done to simplify the margin calculation process and to facilitate <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-start-trading-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beginners in trading</a> to get started quickly. For example, the margin for one lot of EURUSD is fixed at $500. The fixed margin does not involve complicated calculations, and traders can compare the fixed margin list by themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;"><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/Others%20folders/ATFX%20Blog%20Image%202020/ATFX-calculate-margin-forex.jpg" alt="how to calculate profit margin" width="1200" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">3. The basis of trading profit and loss calculation is to understand the point value</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">The point value is the value of one standard point per <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign exchange</a> fluctuation. The currency market habitually does not use percentages to calculate profit and loss. An alternative method is to calculate the total number of points in market fluctuations. For example, if the exchange rate of the currency pair EURUSD rises from 1.2000 to 1.2001 (or drops to 1.999), it fluctuates by one standard point.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">So how to calculate the value of a standard point?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">This involves the 100,000 base currency concept mentioned earlier. The base currency of EURUSD is the Euro. The base currency of 100,000 is 100,000 Euros, and the exchange rate is converted to 120,000 U.S. dollars (taking an exchange rate of 1.2 as an example).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">When the exchange rate rises to 1.2001, the total contract value is US$120,010. Subtract 120,010 from 120,000 USD to get 10 USD difference (it is also 10 USD according to the drop to 1.1999).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">Therefore, the pip value of EURUSD is $10. For USDJPY, the base currency of 100,000 is 100,000 U.S. dollars. Assuming that the current exchange rate is 104.00, then the 100,000 U.S. dollar is converted to 10.4 million Japanese yen. If the exchange rate rises from 104.00 to 104.01, the total contract value is 10401000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">Subtract the 10401,000 after the change from the 10,400,000 before the change, and you can get 1,000 yen (1,000 yen). Then convert 1,000 yen to U.S. dollars, that is, divide 1,000 by 104.1, and get a USDJPY point value of 9.606 U.S. dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;"><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/Others%20folders/ATFX%20Blog%20Image%202020/ATFX-foreign-exchange-transactions.jpg" alt="what is foreign exchange" width="1200" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">4. Calculation of the amount of profit and loss</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">The calculation of the profit and loss amount of a positive currency pair is very simple. You only need to calculate the difference between the buying price and the selling price. After converting the profit and loss points, multiply it by 10 to get the profit and loss amount in US dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">For reverse currency pairs, the point value is often in a floating state, and it is more troublesome to calculate the profit and loss amount. Here is a reference for the reverse currency pair point value under the real-time exchange rate on November 24, 2020, and traders who need it can bookmark:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">The calculation of the foreign exchange market is not only the simple content of margin, point value, profit and loss, but also complex concepts such as account equity, balance, risk rate and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;">Although these values ​​can be calculated automatically through <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forex MT4</a>, for rigorous traders, being able to calculate them independently will greatly improve their understanding of transactions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Risk and Reward Ratio (RRR) falls under the umbrella of risk management. To trade the financial markets, a portion of your funds will be at risk.</p>
<p><span id="more-30460"></span></p>
<p>What risk management does, is ensure you only take the right risks to help you achieve your goals. Using techniques like risk and reward ratio will have a positive effect on your results and put you in a better place for long-term success.</p>

<p>A risk-reward ratio is risking ‘X’ amount of your funds to make ‘Y’ amount of profit.</p>
<p>For example, you might risk £100 in the forex market to try and make a profit of £300. You class this as a 1:3 risk reward ratio.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>It works by understanding how much you will risk making a certain return. The calculation is made before you place the trade.</p>
<p>This is done by using specific orders that your platform should, and if you use <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MT4</a>, will, provide &#8211; a stop loss order and a take profit order.</p>
<p>Once you know where you want to place your stop loss and take profit, you can determine how much you will place on the trade. And in turn, determine how much capital you&#8217;ll have at risk and how much you&#8217;ll stand to gain. This is your risk and reward ratio.</p>

<h2>How to trade using the risk to reward ratio?</h2>
<p>Risk-reward ratio can be used as a measurement when trading forex, equity indices and commodities. Opinions on optimal risk-reward metrics differ depending on the trading strategies followed and the security bought and sold.</p>
<p>As an example, take a non-financial instrument, say a car. If you bought a car for £10,000 and hoped to sell it for £13,000, your risk-reward ratio would be 1:0.3. In the car world, which might be seen as a good return.</p>
<p>Trading forex is a different ball game. There is a higher chance of that original £10,000 going to £0. If you’re trading forex and using that ratio of 1:0.3, you would need to be right 77% of the time to be profitable.</p>
<p>The difference is that leverage is often applied, which increases your risk significantly. The risk of your investment (trade) becoming worthless.</p>

<h2>How to calculate the risk and reward ratio?</h2>
<p>To calculate your risk-reward ratio, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1- <strong>Determine a trade setup</strong>. Your strategy will do this for you, it will tell you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The direction you&#8217;re going to trade</li>
<li>The price you want to enter</li>
</ul>
<p>2 &#8211; <strong>Determine your stop loss price level</strong>. Where will the market have to trade for your trade setup to become invalid? That is where you place your stop loss.</p>
<p>3- <strong>Determine your profit target</strong>. What is the minimum level you think this market will reach? That will be your target level. Anything on top is a bonus.</p>
<p>Now you’ll have your entry and exit points mapped out. This is where you can calculate your risk and reward ratio. The calculation is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pips between entry and stop loss level = risk</li>
<li>Pips between entry and profit level = reward</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>If it were fifty pips to the stop and one hundred pips to the target, the risk reward ratio would be 1:2.</p>
<p>Whilst we have now determined the risk-reward ratio, there are still some key stages to go through to ensure the execution of your risk strategy is accurate.</p></blockquote>
<p>4- <strong>Confirm how much you are willing to lose on the trade</strong>. It might be 1% of your trading account. If your trading account is £10,000, then you would lose no more than £100 on this trade.</p>
<p>5- <strong>Choose the correct position size</strong>. You have the number of pips between your expected entry and your stop loss. You also have the maximum you&#8217;re willing to lose on the trade &#8211; £100. Now you need to determine how many lots you’ll place on the trade. This will also depend on the instrument you&#8217;re trading. See below for a bit more detail about position sizing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How can position sizing help manage your risk?</h3>
<p>What is position sizing? A position size is how many lots (micro, mini or standard) you risk on a single trade. It relates to your account size, setup, and the currency pair you’re trading. Position sizing can be different for each forex trade you place.</p>
<p>If you risk too much on a trade, a few losing trades can eradicate your account. Risk too little, and your account won’t grow enough to hit your targets.</p>
<p>Position sizing helps you set the number of units of the currency pair you’ll buy or sell. To calculate your position sizing, you need the following information.</p>
<p>● The currency pair you’re trading</p>
<p>● Account equity/balance</p>
<p>● Account per cent you’re risking</p>
<p>● Stop-loss you’ll set in pips</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how it works.</p>
<p>You and your position:</p>
<p>● Your account is in dollars</p>
<p>● The currency pair is EUR/USD</p>
<p>● You have $10,000 in your account</p>
<p>● You want to risk 1% of your account</p>
<p>● You intend to set a 100 pip stop-loss.</p>
<p>Your risk:</p>
<p>● You will be risking one hundred micro units of the currency</p>
<p>● The lot size will be 0.1</p>
<p>If you use an advanced platform such as MT4, there are position size calculators you can download for free to help you automatically calculate your position size.</p>

<h2>How to increase risk-reward ratio?</h2>
<p>There are two ways you can increase your risk-reward ratio.</p>
<p>1- Increase your profit target. When you increase your target level and keep your stop-loss the same, your RRR will increase.</p>
<p>If your stop loss is fifty pips away, and your target is one hundred pips away, your RRR is 1:2. If you move your target to 150 pips away, your RRR will increase to 1:3.</p>
<p>2- Decrease your stop-loss level. Moving your stop loss level closer to your entry will reduce your risk. Using the same example (50 pip stop loss and 100 pip target), if you move your stop loss to twenty-five pips from the entry, your RRR changes from 1:2 to 1:4.</p>
<p>Whilst both are viable methods of increasing your risk reward ratio, you must ensure that whatever action you take aligns with your strategy. Ensure that if you move either level that they are placed in a strategic position.</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, suppose you were originally going to place your stop loss fifty pips away from your entry because that is the level that makes the trade invalid. In these circumstances, moving it closer would not make strategic sense because you could get stopped out before your trade became invalid and reached the 50-pip mark.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to make trade decisions with the risk-reward ratio?</h3>
<p>Traders cannot ignore risk versus reward as part of their trading plan. You must determine the point at which your trade goes wrong, and you must decide what represents a realistic target. You also must develop a sense of what’s probable based on market history, both recent and longer-term. Putting a huge target on a trade because it makes your RRR look good won’t make the target any more likely to be reached.</p>
<p>You cannot afford to take a blasé attitude towards RRR. It’s as crucial to your bottom-line as your method and strategy.</p>
<p>Do ensure you record all your trades and their RRR so that you will be able to go back and analyse your results. This is key to improving your strategy.</p>
<p><em>For example</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve taken one hundred trades</li>
<li>Each trade risked £100</li>
<li>You made money on fifty trades</li>
<li>You lost money on fifty trades</li>
<li>Every trade originally had a RRR of 1:2</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Results</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will have lost £5,000 in the losing trades</li>
<li>You will have made £10,000 in the winning trades</li>
<li>You would have made £5,000 profit</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>What if your psychology had got in the way? You had moved your stop loss and taken profit before your target was hit. Having analysed your results, you found:</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Based on your profit and loss for each trade, your RRR was 1:1.2</li>
<li>You made money on fifty trades</li>
<li>You lost money on fifty trades</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Results</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You lost £5,000 in losing trades</li>
<li>You made £6,000 in winning trades</li>
<li>Your profit was only £1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensuring you keep a record of your results will help you see your <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/why-do-day-traders-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistakes</a> and make corrections that’ll improve your future performance.</p>
<h2>What is risk management?</h2>
<p>In trading, risk management is the process you take to protect your trading account. The word &#8216;risk&#8217; refers to &#8216;how likely you are to incur a loss&#8217;. This will include risk per trade and your overall market exposure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk per trade</strong> would mean how much you were going to lose on an individual trade.</li>
<li><strong>Risk on market exposure</strong> refers to how much you would lose if all your open trades were to lose.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might only risk 0.5% on each trade but if you have one hundred trades open at that risk, your market exposure would be 50% of your trading account.</p>
<p>Market exposure also refers to how much risk you have on one market and not just all of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, you might have a 0.5% risk on a forex trade &#8211; GBP/USD. However, if you were to have six other trades open at the same risk in the following pairs: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CAD, AUD/USD, USD/CHF, and NZD/USD, you would have a total of 3.5% at risk on the US dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would also depend on your position in each trade, but if you were buying USD in all examples, you would leave yourself open to increased risk if the USD were to sell off.</p>
<p>Risk management is a simple discipline to develop and put into practice, and it’s essential to your progress as a trader. You can manage your risk in a variety of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the number of trades you take, per session and week</li>
<li>Define and limit the markets you trade</li>
<li>Limit your risk per trade</li>
<li>Limit your overall risk and market exposure</li>
<li>Use stops and limit orders</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why it’s essential to take a balanced approach to risk management?</h3>
<p>When you sail across a harbour, you stand more chance of staying afloat if the weight on the boat is evenly balanced. Balancing your risk will help you stay in the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market</a> for the long term without getting your feet wet!</p>
<p>Most of us instinctively take a balanced approach to risk management in our everyday lives. Take crossing a busy road. We will assess the speed of the oncoming traffic, the gaps between vehicles, the width of the road and whether there is safe stage post midway across. Some days we’ll go for the gap but on others &#8211; say if it’s raining &#8211; we’ll reassess and decide to walk to the crossing point.</p>
<p>That balancing of risk is exactly what you must do in the markets. With <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/market-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading conditions</a> continually changing, constantly reassess your risk. Ask yourself if it still fits with your strategy. Are you taking too many trades? Are you risking too much per trade? Are you being realistic? If necessary, take action to rebalance.</p>

<h2>5 Risk Management Techniques</h2>
<p>Risk management techniques are vital to the success of your <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading strategy</a>. It&#8217;s what separates great traders from average traders. Being able to apply these techniques at the right time will help you to achieve your targets.</p>
<h3>1. Set a plan with trading strategies</h3>
<p>A trade plan is a set of rules that govern how you trade. It’ll be a set of criteria that you must follow to the tee. This ensures your trading is consistent and so you can easily track its performance.</p>
<h4>How do you set up a trading strategy?</h4>
<p>There are a few things that you need to determine to set up your <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/day-trading-strategies-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>When will you be able to trade?</em></li>
<li><em>What instruments will you trade?</em></li>
<li>Trade setup. <em>What analysis technique will you use?</em>
<ul>
<li><em>How will you determine the market direction?</em></li>
<li><em>How will you determine your entry?</em></li>
<li><em>How will you determine your exit?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk management.
<ul>
<li><em>How much will you risk per trade?</em></li>
<li><em>How much market exposure will you have?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trade execution.
<ul>
<li><em>What determines your actual buy or sell decision?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trade management.
<ul>
<li><em>Will you add to or remove from your position?</em></li>
<li><em>Will you reduce the stop loss?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can answer all these questions and be consistent in the way you execute your strategy, then you’ll be able to better manage your risk.</p>
<h3>2. Diversify your portfolio</h3>
<p>Diversifying your portfolio means buying different instruments. You can diversify your portfolio within an asset class, or you can diversify by trading all asset classes.</p>
<h4>Diversifying within an asset class</h4>
<p>This entails taking positions in instruments that aren’t directly correlated. We’ll offer two examples: forex and stocks.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Forex </strong>&#8211; If you trade <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forex</a>, you have access to any currency pair you want (assuming your broker offers them). If you were to take several positions in currency pairs that contained the US dollar, then you would leave yourself exposed to how each different currency behaved.</p>
<p>If the USD were to become strong off the back of an interest rate decision and you had sold it in several currency pairs then you would be looking at some negative balances on your trades.</p>
<p>It’s therefore important to make sure you know exactly what currencies you have exposure to. If you had two positions in two different USD pairs at 0.5% risk, and you decided to take one more of the same risk, you would have 1.5% reliant on what the USD would do. It might therefore be better to look for another position in a pair that doesn’t include the USD.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spreading your risk across several sectors can protect you from such catastrophes.</p>
<p>You can also diversify between asset classes. When trading with a broker like ATFX, you have three different asset classes available, so you can better spread your risk.</p>
<p>Whilst all markets are interlinked, they do move separately. Factors that affect oil are less likely to affect GBP/USD.</p>

<h3>3. Add trading tools to your armoury</h3>
<p>There are lots of trading tools that you can apply to your risk management strategy. Below are a few types to start thinking about:</p>
<p><strong>Technical indicators </strong>&#8211; These offer <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/mt4-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading signals</a> based on mathematical equations. These let you know when you should enter or exit a trade. They would normally be used as part of your trading strategy if you used technical analysis as your main approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/economic-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Economic calendar </strong></a>&#8211; This will show you when market-related news is due to be released. Depending on the release, your research will tell you which market it might affect. For instance, a Bank of England inflation report, will have an impact on the GBP/USD. If you’re a stock trader, then you would watch out for earnings reports from the stocks you were looking to trade.</p>
<p><strong>Trading service tools </strong>&#8211; Some platforms will offer advanced order types that will help you manage your trades and your risk.</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, you can use an automatic trailing stop. This is set to a certain distance from the price and will move in line with the price. It will only move if the price moves in your favour. If you set your trailing stop loss to always stay fifty pips behind the price, and you buy at 1.5000, the stop will be at 1.4950.</p>
<p>If the price moves to 1.5010, then the stop would follow to 1.4960. If the price moved back to 1.5000, the stop would remain at 1.4960. Note that you should only use a tool like this if it is in your strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Auto trading </strong>&#8211; Automatic trading is becoming increasingly popular. This is where you set in your trading parameters and let an algorithm take the trades on your behalf. If you set the correct stop loss and take profit levels, then you should never breach your risk management rules. MT4 is a world leader when it comes to auto trading with Expert Advisors (EAs) used to automate your trading. Feel free to try a demo and test out MT4 with your strategy to see how it might perform without your interference.</p>
<p>Tools such as <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/education-and-tools/trading-central" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trading Central</a> or Autochartist offer a huge amount and can add value to your trading. They can offer first class technical analysis reports, technical strategies that you can experiment with, as well as advanced indicators that are specific to MT4.</p>
<h3>4. Calculate your additional costs</h3>
<p>As an independent <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-become-a-trader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial trader</a>, you will have fixed and variable costs. Therefore, you must continually reassess your trading expenses to ensure you’re not paying more than you should and need to. Overtrading can have a devastating effect on your bottom line.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate your additional costs?</h4>
<p>1- First you need to know what they are. You will incur three main charges when trading through a <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/type-of-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broker</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread &#8211; difference between the bid and the ask price</li>
<li>Commission &#8211; the set amount charged to take a trade</li>
<li>Overnight charges &#8211; the fee you pay to hold your position overnight on leveraged trades</li>
</ul>
<p>2- Next you need to understand which applies to you. This will depend on the instruments you trade and the broker you use. Understand how much you are charged per trade and overnight.</p>
<p>3- Determine how often you trade and whether you hold overnight positions (if you trade on leveraged products).</p>
<p>4- Average the number of trades you take per day, per week or per month to give you an idea about the volume you trade.</p>
<p>5- Once you have your volume and cost per trade, you can then multiply, to figure out how much you’re paying the broker to trade.</p>
<p>If you find this to be more than you expected, it’s worth shopping around for better value. Remember, costs will influence your overall risk management strategy. If you can keep trading costs down, then you’ll have more to risk elsewhere.</p>
<h3>5. Keep your emotions in check (Beat your feelings with trading psychology)</h3>
<p>Trading psychology is one of the hardest things in trading to manage. You’re trying to manage yourself and your emotions.</p>
<p>You’ll find that you’re not alone in this. All the financial markets can be attributed to states of psychology. The more you trade and analyse the markets, the more you’ll notice these periods within the markets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20F%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Risk%20and%20reward%20ratio%20(pillar%202)/analysis-trading-strategies-risk-and-reward-ratio-trading-chart-image.jpg?quality=low&amp;width=821&amp;name=analysis-trading-strategies-risk-and-reward-ratio-trading-chart-image.jpg" alt="risk management techniques" width="821" /></p>
<p>The market moves in cycles, and you can attribute different emotions to different periods in that cycle. From peak to trough, you may well encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hope</li>
<li>Relief</li>
<li>Optimism</li>
<li>Excitement</li>
<li>Thrill</li>
<li>Euphoria</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Denial</li>
<li>Fear</li>
<li>Desperation</li>
<li>Panic</li>
<li>Capitulation</li>
<li>Despondency</li>
<li>Depression</li>
</ul>
<p>The market&#8217;s psychology will continue like this because that is how the participants feel.</p>
<h4>How do you keep your emotions in check?</h4>
<p><strong>Trading plan </strong>&#8211; You might be bored with hearing this, but it’s the single thing that makes a difference repeatedly. Set yourself a trading plan and stick to it. It is the first step to trying to control your emotions</p>
<p><strong>Record your trades </strong>&#8211; Keep a record of your accomplished trades. When you look at them in the light of day without the emotions of the markets behind you, you’ll see your performance in black and white. And you’ll be able to see which trades were controlled by your emotions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any that you went over your risk parameters? Probably because of your emotions.</li>
<li>Any you cut short? Probably because of your emotions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automation </strong>&#8211; Taking the emotions out of trading and letting a robot do it for you. If you can set up a strategy that has just a few variables that you can plug into an Expert Advisor on MT4, then you’re more likely to be able to stick to your trade plan and risk management strategy.</p>
<p>Setting stops and take profit limits are forms of automation as your platform can be programmed to execute your instructions when certain levels are triggered. If you also select your entries through automation, then you have no reason to intervene in your trades manually, therefore removing emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Extra risk management tips</h2>
<p>If the above five techniques aren’t quite enough, we thought we’d give you some extras to get your teeth into.</p>
<h4>Only risk money you won’t miss</h4>
<p>Don’t trade with money you need to pay the bills. Remember, it doesn’t matter how small your account size, you can always add funds to your account once you gain experience and confidence.</p>
<p>Don’t put all your savings into a trading account. Instead, decide what portion of your savings you can risk. Are you happy to lose say 10% to learn to become a better trader?</p>
<h4>Consider your risk tolerance</h4>
<p>Your tolerance of risk depends on your ambition and your psyche. You will only discover what it is once you expose yourself to live market conditions with real money at risk. If you find yourself sweating over results, and manually interfering too early thereby corrupting your trading plan, you need to dial down your risk per trade.</p>
<h4>Set realistic risk-reward metrics</h4>
<p>You need to set realistic risk-reward levels. Allow the market to guide you.</p>
<p>You can use tools such as the ATR indicator (average true range) to determine the typical range a currency pair has oscillated in the past. If for example EUR/USD has operated in a 150-pip range over the past weeks’ sessions, it is not realistic to target a two hundred pip move in the current session to capture 1:5 risk-reward (profit).</p>
<h4>Keep your risk vs reward consistent</h4>
<p>Beginners find it very tempting to increase their risk when they’re in a winning position, but they often fail to adjust the risk when they’re in losing situations. Don’t meddle and micro-manage. Let your trading plan do its job.</p>
<h4>Understand margin and leverage</h4>
<p>Using leverage allows you to trade more money than your initial deposit because of margin trading. Leverage increases your profits, but the same phenomenon equally applies to your losses. You need to understand how leverage and margin impacts on your overall performance and trading.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to use high leverage to aim for significant profits but being over-leveraged can lead to large losses due to a mistake on your part or a sudden market movement.</p>
<h3>Is risk management a one-time plan?</h3>
<p>While sound money management needs to be a permanent feature of your trading plan, your risk management technique should not be permanently fixed. Attitude to risk will evolve as your trading develops. And you might begin as a day trader but decide that swing trading fits your psyche and time constraints better. Your risk parameters will then change as your trading changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We don’t want you to be one of those statistics that falls into the ‘failed trader’ category. Understanding why traders fail is the first step towards avoiding that fate. If things aren’t going right, how do you turn it around? We’ll offer up some straightforward remedies, to help you get back on track.</p>

<h2>Why do day traders fail? 10 reasons why day traders fail</h2>
<p>There are lots of reasons traders fail. We’ll cover the ten biggest reasons, from risk management to psychology, from trading plans to broker choices. Let’s make sure that if you recognise some of these traits in your own trading, you take action immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Thinking trading is easy money</h3>
<p>If online financial trading were easy money, we’d all be millionaires; in fact, there’d be no market because no one would lose. It’d be like playing a broken slot machine that kept paying out. Unfortunately it’s not easy and it won’t keep spitting out money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>So, why do people think it&#8217;s easy money?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s glamorised by popular culture. The internet, film and other media all show it to be easy. They tell the story of the few that make it big, without showing the majority who have struggled.</p>
<p>You might even have friends who trade and tell you when they’ve had a good day. You’re thinking &#8211; ‘it must be easy if they can do it’. However, they probably don’t tell you when they’ve had a bad day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How would a professional think?</h4>
<p>If you were to ask an experienced trader, they’d tell you that knowing mistakes traders make from the outset could have saved them a lot of the pain and frustration. It’s worth repeating: there are no shortcuts, but if you recognise this and cut out the mistakes now, you’ll get to where you want to be a lot quicker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What’s the solution to thinking trading is easy?</h4>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 360px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20G%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Why%20do%20day%20traders%20fail%20(child%202)/analysis-trading-strategies-why-do-day-traders-fail-people-image.jpg" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-why-do-day-traders-fail-people-image" width="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-start-trading-for-beginners" rel="noopener">Get into trading</a> with your eyes open. Don’t let a tabloid story influence your thinking. Concentrate on learning the basics, controlling your emotions, putting in place strict money management rules, and learning how not to lose.</p>
<p>Find someone you can trust in the industry and speak to them, if your broker is regulated, reach out to them  . Despite misconceptions, most regulated brokers want you to succeed. The better you do, the better they do. Reach out for a chat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Sticking to one trading strategy and be consistent</h3>
<p>There is no one size fits all solution to trading. Markets rhyme, but they never repeat. Every moment in the market is unique; therefore, you have to be ready to adapt to this ever-changing landscape. And what works one day might fall flat the next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why can&#8217;t I change my strategy if it doesn&#8217;t work?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can. However, you need to prove that it doesn&#8217;t work first. If you take 10 of the same trade and find that only two are successful then you could reasonably argue that it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p style="border: none;">But a counter argument is that if you take that same trade another 90 times, making a total of 100 trades, there’s a chance that you might make 60 successful trades and 40 will fail proving that the strategy does work. Be consistent and give it time. Impatience is a big reason traders fail.</p>
<h4 style="border: none;">How do you know when to change?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You need to test your strategy and have confidence in it for the long term. Make sure you have set robust criteria to enter the trade and remember to track your results. Without a clear record, you won&#8217;t be able to properly analyse your trading performance.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Their emotions get in the way. [Trading psychology]</h3>
<p>As a trader, you have to be highly adaptable, park your ego and realise that the market is not out to get you. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets" rel="noopener">The financial markets</a> don’t care about you, they don’t have emotions. You need to adopt the same persona; never take it personally and never look for revenge.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20G%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Why%20do%20day%20traders%20fail%20(child%202)/analysis-trading-strategies-why-do-day-traders-fail-ipad-image.jpg" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-why-do-day-traders-fail-ipad-image" width="1200" /></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why are emotions so bad?</h4>
<p>Some aren&#8217;t. Patience is both an emotion and a skill, and is a great virtue. However, other emotions like greed and nervousness will cloud your judgement and remove the consistency a trading plan provides. The idea is to be robotic, take the same trade blueprint and trade it over and over again , despite what the markets and your emotions are telling you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Signs that emotions are getting in the way</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cutting profits short</strong>. You have a target in mind but you see the market go against you slightly, so you panic and take your profit too soon. The market may well have reached your target before your stop, but you will have cut your profits short because of your emotions.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Letting losers run</strong>. The market is going against you and approaching your stop loss, so you move your stop further away to ‘<em>make sure</em>’ it doesn&#8217;t get hit. The market continues against you and it gets hit anyway. Now you have a trade that lost more than you originally planned.</li>
<li><strong>Adding to your trades</strong>. You see the market going in your favour, so you buy more (or sell more). The market reverses and now you are left with a larger trade and larger losses because you got carried away by a temporarily favourable market.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to manage your emotions?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can control your emotions by adopting a forensic approach to your trading from day one. Creating a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies" rel="noopener">trading plan</a> and sticking to it will help remove emotions from your trading.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to record your trades. Seeing your results in black and white will show you how well (or not so well) you’ve been sticking to your plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Not enough planning and understanding of Risk management</h3>
<p><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/economic-calendar" rel="noopener">Plan your trades</a> and trade your plan. You’ve heard it a lot and you’ll continue to hear it, you need to create a trading plan. Then you need to stick to it and be strict with your <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" rel="noopener">risk management rules</a>. Novice traders often overlook the impact risk can have on their trading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How much to risk per trade?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before we answer that, remember that longevity is the key to trading success. So, with that in mind, let’s look at an example.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Imagine you risk 0.5% of your account per trade (if you have an account of £2,000, then 0.5% would be £10 per trade).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you take losses of £10 each time, you will need 200 consecutive losing trades to blow your account.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Now, imagine you risk 5% per trade.</li>
<li>That would only be 20 losing trades in a row for your funds to disappear.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Why 20 trades? Well, 5% of £2000 is £100, so if you lose £100, twenty times in a row you would have lost all the capital in your trading account.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, the amount you risk per trade has a huge affect on how quickly you potentially could lose. The same is true for how much you could win, but this is one of the reasons traders do fail &#8211; they risk too much on each trade and blow their accounts quickly.</p>
<p>Set from day one what you perceive to be a reasonable level of risk and stick to it (the smaller the better for longevity).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Can I make any money risking only 0.5%?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can. Another quick reminder that longevity is key to trading success. It&#8217;s those traders who want to make money instantly that will struggle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re risking 0.5% to make 0.5% (a 1:1 risk to reward ratio), and you make one more successful than unsuccessful trade every week for 50 weeks, your account would be up 25% on the year. The same applies if you were to lose one more trade each week, just in this case you would be down 25%.</p>
<p>This very brief example illustrates how simple risk management aims, matched with realistic, patient ambitions written into a trading plan, can provide an excellent base from you to progress.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20G%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Why%20do%20day%20traders%20fail%20(child%202)/analysis-trading-strategies-why-do-day-traders-fail-ipad2-image.jpg" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-why-do-day-traders-fail-ipad2-image" width="1200" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="border: none;">5. Not enough trading analysis</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To succeed, you must learn how to analyse the markets. If you don&#8217;t analyse the market and come up with a view, you might as well flip a coin.</p>
<p>Therefore being proficient at either technical or fundamental <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis" rel="noopener">analysis</a> (ideally both) will help you make better trading decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>When is enough analysis?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enough is when you’ve created a strategy based on some form of analysis that has proven to work.</p>
<p>You could add more to create a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/day-trading-strategies-for-beginners" rel="noopener">different strategy</a> but if you understand enough to have one that works, then you&#8217;re on the right track for success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">Which should I learn, technical or fundamental analysis?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s up to you. Gathering a fundamental view of the market tends to take longer. You need to understand the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors in play that might alter market sentiment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A technical approach is normally easier for beginners because you can learn a rule based strategy in less time and without having to have a deep understanding of economics.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, you would use both to come up with a strategy. If your fundamental view agrees with your technical, then you have extra confirmation of the market direction.</p>

<h3>6. Following the wrong advice</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The online retail trading industry is awash with information from blogs, websites, forums, articles, <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/education-and-tools/trading-webinars" rel="noopener">webinars</a>, e-books, etc. Ensuring you&#8217;re getting the right advice is important. ‘Fake news’ unfortunately is rife, so make sure you do your research and find a vendor you trust.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Where do I start looking for advice?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your chosen broker should be your first port of call for credible information. Your broker should want you to succeed. It’s in their interests because successful, confident traders trade more. Your broker should publish market analyses, <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/market-news" rel="noopener">market news</a>, <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/education-and-tools/trading-education" rel="noopener">e-books and blogs</a> to help you make progress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After your broker, you should be looking at well established publishers and those that write for them. Or if you’re lucky enough to know and trust someone in the industry then utilise their advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Forums can be hazardous environments for traders because many marketers will post trying to sell you their products. The volume of opinion and noise can be both confusing and overwhelming.</p>
<p>Make sure you test the advice you receive to see if it’s accurate. Look at analyses and predictions and check later how accurate they were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Allowing small losses to turn into significant losses</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We touched on this in point 3. Never allow your losses to grow. You should have stop losses in place to limit the potential damage to your trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start by deciding what risk you&#8217;re prepared to attach to a trade and the point the market needs to reach before it makes your trade invalid.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How would small losses become large losses?</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adding to losing trades</strong>. The idea that you&#8217;re &#8216;getting a better price&#8217; is dangerous. If you have planned to lose a certain amount on the trade and you add more to it, you are suddenly risking more than your original plan. Don&#8217;t fall into this trap.</li>
<li><strong>Moving your stop loss away</strong>. If the market is approaching your stop loss, it is very easy to move it away just &#8216;to allow the market to bounce back&#8217;. More often than not this doesn&#8217;t happen and you keep moving it away. Before you know it, you&#8217;re losing more than you had originally planned and are praying for it to go back to your original stop level. The stop should be there for a reason. If it gets hit, it&#8217;s because your strategy wasn&#8217;t right on this one.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Not taking transaction costs into account</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s helpful to have a clear understanding of what you’ll pay in charges to your broker for each trade. If you’re a day trader, low costs are crucial to making your method and strategy work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, if you were to take an average of 10 trades a day, at £10 per pip. Comparing two brokers, one that charges on average 3 pips per trade with one that charges 1 pip per trade, let&#8217;s have a look at the sums below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 36pt;">Broker 1 charges 3 pips per trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 36pt;">&#8211; 10 trades = 30 pips paid to the broker</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 36pt;">&#8211; 30 pips x £10 = £300 fees to the broker</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 36pt;">Broker 2 charges 1 pip per trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 36pt;">&#8211; 10 trades = 10 pips paid to the broker</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 36pt;">&#8211; 10 pips x £10 = £100 fees to the broker</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can see that your bottom line would be £200 poorer when using broker 1 compared with broker 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any business, you have fixed and variable costs. Controlling both of these is essential to success. Squeezing these costs to a minimum is your responsibility. You should carefully analyse your brokers fees to ensure you&#8217;re not paying too much for spreads, commissions or overnight charges.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">9. Choosing the wrong type of broker</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 393px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20G%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Why%20do%20day%20traders%20fail%20(child%202)/analysis-trading-strategies-why-do-day-traders-fail-chart-image.jpg" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-why-do-day-traders-fail-chart-image" width="393" />You must avoid choosing the wrong <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/type-of-brokers" rel="noopener">type of broker</a>. The online trading industry has very high standards, and many brokers have put in place robust compliance foundations to ensure the safety of your funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Which broker is the wrong broker?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A broker that’s not regulated is the wrong broker. Why? Because they don’t have oversight from <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/about-us/atfx-regulators" rel="noopener">financial regulators</a> that are specifically put in place to ensure the safety of your funds. There are lots of other criteria that you should look for when choosing a broker but one of the most important is whether they’re regulated or not.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How do I know if they’re regulated?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a broker is regulated, they’ll make it fairly clear to you. Why wouldn’t a broker want to promote the fact that it’s regulated by an authority that looks out for your money? Look for clues on their website. They might have a page dedicated to the regulators or you might find a mention in the footer of the homepage.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">10. A bad Risk-Reward ratio</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" rel="noopener">risk-reward ratio</a> (RRR) aligns with your hit rate (the amount of successful trades you take).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A bad RRR would mean that over a set amount of trades, you end up losing more money than you make.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below are examples of RRR and the minimum hit rate required to be profitable:</p>
<table style="border: none #99acc2; padding-left: 132.9pt; border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 354px;" border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 30px;">
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Risk to reward ratio</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">Minimum hit rate</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 30px;">
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">1:1</td>
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">50%</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 30px;">
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; border-width: 1px; text-align: center;">1:2</td>
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">33%</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 30px;">
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; border-width: 1px; text-align: center;">1:3</td>
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">25%</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 30px;">
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">1:0.7</td>
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">60%</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 30px;">
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">1:0.3</td>
<td style="width: 154px; height: 30px; text-align: center;">75%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, the smaller your RRR, the higher your hit rate needs to be. Therefore it’s not just a bad RRR you need to look out for, it’s the combination of RRR and hit rate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which RRR should I aim for?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This will depend on your strategy. Test to see how often your trades are successful (what your own hit rate is) and then you&#8217;ll know what RRR you need to be aiming for to be profitable.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">How to become a successful trader?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are lots of things you can do <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-become-a-trader" rel="noopener">to become a successful trader</a>. We’ve broken it down into three main areas that you need to focus on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20H%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Type%20of%20brokers%20(child%202)/analysis-trading-strategies-type-of-brokers-graph-image.jpg" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-type-of-brokers-graph-image" width="1200" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">1. Acquire knowledge</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Learning a new skill is exciting, during the process you will see yourself improving with time. Trading is no different. To be successful, you need to learn the ropes. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/education-and-tools" rel="noopener">Acquire as much knowledge</a> as you can in the right order and you&#8217;ll start to see your understanding and results improve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">re you read about the subject, the more of an understanding you’ll have about the markets and what influences them. You’ll also learn something new with every trade you take, be it about yourself and your psychology or the market and how it behaves. The best way to learn is to keep trading. Athletes become Olympic athletes by practising and it&#8217;s the same with trading.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">2. Build confidence and experience</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Confidence is important in trading. Not confidence in yourself but confidence in your strategy. Taking the same trade every time without hesitation is difficult and when you don&#8217;t have confidence in your strategy, it&#8217;s even more difficult.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Confidence will come with experience. The more you prove to yourself that your strategy does work the more confident you&#8217;ll become. Lots of traders find trading a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-accounts/demo-account" rel="noopener">demo account</a> a great place to build confidence, both in yourself and in your strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You also know that you won&#8217;t be right 100% of the time, so having the confidence to be wrong and continue is also important. This comes with experience and patience. Don’t let losses knock your confidence, you’re in it for the long run.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Understand and manage the risk</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can&#8217;t hear this too much. Understand what risk is and understand how you can manage it to gain an element of control over your trading outcomes.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know what will happen in the market at any given moment but you can be sure to limit your risk per trade. And if your risk-reward ratio is on point, then you&#8217;re in line to achieve the returns you&#8217;re aiming for.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br />
</strong><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/what-is-a-broker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is a broker?</a></h2>
<p>A financial broker conducts transactions between buyers and sellers of <a href="/en/markets" rel="noopener">financial products</a>. They earn a commission when the deal gets done. Some brokers will act as a buyer or seller and become a principal party. This basically means they take the other side of the trade. If you&#8217;re buying, it&#8217;s the broker that&#8217;s selling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20H%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Type%20of%20brokers%20(child%202)/analysis-trading-strategies-type-of-brokers-graph-image.jpg" alt="analysis-trading-strategies-type-of-brokers-graph-image" width="1200" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What is a stockbroker?</h3>
<p>A stockbroker is a regulated professional that (normally) represents a brokerage firm or broker-dealer. They buy and sell stocks (shares in a company) for both retail and institutional clients. Whilst their focus tends to be on stocks, they might also dabble in other securities like forex and <a href="/en/markets/commodities" rel="noopener">commodities</a>. Stock brokers will make trades on behalf of their clients through stock exchanges and get paid via fees and/ or commissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What is a broker-dealer?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A broker-dealer is another term for a financial broker. They work with individual investors or firms who want to buy and sell securities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Broker-dealer’s act as both a broker and as a dealer.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">When acting as a broker, they’re middlemen for transactions between two different investors exchanging securities.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">When acting as dealers, they are buying or selling for their benefit and on their account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What does a broker do?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brokers are middlemen between you and the trading world. They match buyers with sellers. If you want to sell an asset at one price, they will find a buyer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They now provide you with the trading platforms to take trades and give you the opportunity to be matched with either a buyer or seller (depending which one you are).</p>
<p>Due to the competitive nature of the forex broker industry, brokers are now doing more and more. They offer their clients education, tools, plus a host of services and products in an effort to appeal to their prospective clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">What qualifications do brokers need?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an individual broker within a brokerage, you don&#8217;t need to have any type of qualification. Some brokerages might have stricter requirements than others but in general, there is no requirement like there is for accountants, doctors or architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To open an execution brokerage business, no-one in the business needs any specific qualifications. To be authorised by certain regulatory bodies you must adhere to their standards and protocols. Each authority is different and will have its own level of compliance. It, therefore, depends on the country in which they operate and where they&#8217;re legally registered.</p>
<p>To be regulated by <a href="/en/about-us/atfx-regulators" rel="noopener">highly regarded authorities</a> like the FCA you must comply with strict protocols. Whilst you don&#8217;t need any qualifications to start a brokerage, the FCA will assess the experience, fitness, and propriety of senior management before agreeing to authorise them. It&#8217;s not like anyone can just open a brokerage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How do brokers make their money?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brokers make their money by charging you to execute a trade, both sides, when you’re buying and selling. Normally the charge comes in two forms, a commission per transaction or a spread &#8211; the difference between the price they quote you to buy and the price they quote you to sell. The actual price of the asset will be somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two prices you’re quoted are called the bid and the ask price. Here’s an example to show you how a broker makes money on a <a href="/en/markets/forex-trading" rel="noopener">forex trade</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The market price is 1.5000.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The spread of the currency pair is 2.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">You are trading at £10 a pip.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The bid price would be 1.4999.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The ask price would be 1.5001.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you buy in this market, you will enter the market at 1.5001 whilst the actual price is still at 1.5000.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">You enter at a loss because you are paying that 1 pip to the broker.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore you will pay the broker £10 to enter the trade.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Broker profit = £10.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spreads can be either fixed or variable. Variable spreads change depending on how the market moves. If there’s a significant economic event or data release such as an interest rate change, the spread could quickly change due to the volume of orders trying to get matched. Using the example above, if the spread widened to 3 during an announcement and you continued to buy, you would pay the broker £30 rather than £10.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brokers can also charge commissions and a spread on a trade. This would mean you pay the spread as per the above example but you would also be charged a set fee per transaction. You’d be wise to stay away from these types of brokers as costs can spiral.</p>
<p>Brokers who are well-capitalised and work with tier 1 banks usually offer the most competitive pricing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">What are the different types of brokers ?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several different types of brokers can execute your trades. There are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No dealing desk brokers (NDD)</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Electronic communication network brokers (ECN)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Straight-through processing brokers (STP)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Hybrids</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing desk brokers (DD)</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Market-makers</p>
<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1115px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20H%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Type%20of%20brokers%20(child%202)/analysistrading-strategies-type-of-brokers(child%202)-image2.jpg" alt="Type of trading brokers_what are the different types of broker" width="1115" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">No dealing desk brokers</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No dealing desk brokers (NDD) are, unsurprisingly, those that don’t operate dealing desks. Your order gets sent directly to the market without any interference or delay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NDD forex brokers will normally work directly with several liquidity providers to get you the most competitive prices.</p>
<p>With NDD brokers, you get direct exposure to the precise spreads available to customers from the interbank market. The precise spreads are normally passed on to the client but in order for them to make money they will apply exchange fees or commissions to your trades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">STP Broker</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A straight-through processing broker (STP) will route your order to the market ASAP without any delay and interference. Like most brokers, they make money from the spread and the commissions they generate on the trades you place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">STP brokers pass the orders directly to their liquidity provider. Liquidity providers can include Banks, Hedge Funds, Investment corporations or other brokers. STP brokers usually have several liquidity providers; increasing the number of providers in the liquidity system should, in theory, lead to better fills for the client. Many STP brokers use banks who trade on the Interbank market as their liquidity sources. The Interbank market is the highest-level foreign exchange market where banks exchange currencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few key facts about STP brokers:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They don’t pass orders through dealing desks</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They process clients requests without delay</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They don’t send re-quotes to clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They allow clients to trade during volatile periods (like news releases)</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">ECN Broker</h3>
<p class="blog-slider">An Electronic Communications Network (ECN) broker places your order into a liquidity pool of continually changing prices. The pool of pricing may be created by tier 1 banks who transact billions of FX requests and orders each day. ECN brokers attempt to get your market order filled at the best price and ASAP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ECN provides an electronic system for buyers and sellers to come together to execute trades. The network matches all the buying and selling orders in the pool of pricing (the exchange). If specific order information is not there, then the ECN delivers the highest bid and lowest ask price on the open market.</p>
<p class="blog-slider">All ECN brokers have access to the same feed and trade at the prices quoted. They’re popular because no trader should have a built-in advantage over the other.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Hybrid Broker (ECN + STP)</h3>
<p class="blog-slider">Brokers who offer the dual system of STP and ECN are known as hybrid brokers. Orders are routed to the ECN liquidity pool and market ASAP, without any interference or price manipulation. These hybrids are considered one of the most efficient, transparent and <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/risk-reward-ratio-management-techniques" rel="noopener">safest methods for traders</a> to access markets.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Dealing desk brokers</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name suggests, a dealing desk broker operates a dealing desk. The issue many have with brokers working dealing desks is that they often take the other side of a clients trade, therefore are the counterparty. This then throws up the question, does the broker have the clients best interest at heart when they’re the counterparty?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By setting the bid and ask price, there’s an argument that they have an advantage over their counterparty, in this case the client. Some people do believe that this type of trader takes advantage of traders but there are also many others that appreciate the fixed spreads that they do offer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Market Maker</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A market maker makes a market for their clients. They’re often liquidity suppliers &#8211; an entity that buys a large volume of an asset and then distributes it to other financial institutions who then make it available to retail investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Market makers offer a buy and sell quote to other financial companies, and they make a profit from this bid-offer spread. Their mission is to provide competitive quotes for the complete trading ecosystem.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">How do you choose a broker?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Choosing a broker is an important decision when you <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/how-to-start-trading-for-beginners" rel="noopener">start trading</a>. The charges they apply will have an affect on your bottom line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an example, imagine you&#8217;re an FX trader taking around ten trades a day. You pay an extra pip or two per transaction (let’s stick at the low level and call it 1), and you’re looking to bank on an average of ten pips per trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That means you’re looking to make 100 pips in a day. If you’re paying 1 pip to get in and 1 pip to get out of the trade, it means you have to make 12 pips on each trade to hit your target. That means you have to make 20% more profit to hit your 100 pip target. Minimising your transaction costs is essential.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">So how do you actually choose a broker? What’s the best process?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same way as choosing any provider. Doing your research and creating a checklist of everything you want in a broker. This might include security, value or customer service, or ideally all of the above. We’ve put together a few suggestions of the types of things you should have on your checklist when you’re doing your research</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: normal; text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" style="width: 1200px;" src="https://www.atfx.com/hubfs/ATFX.COM/NEW%20pages/Pages%20-%20go%20live%20-%20Analysis/Analysis%20-%20B%20-%20Trading%20strategies/Analysis%20-%20H%20-%20Trading%20strategies%20-%20Type%20of%20brokers%20(child%202)/analysistrading-strategies-type-of-brokers(child%202)-image1.png" alt="analysistrading-strategies-type-of-brokers(child 2)-image1" width="1200" /></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Regulation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are they regulated? Who are they regulated by? It’s always sensible to go with a regulated broker so do make sure this question makes it onto your checklist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reputation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do the clients of the broker say about them? Bad news travels quickly on the internet, especially in the trading community. So if the broker has lots of genuinely poor reviews, you might want to cross them off your list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Spreads and costs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How much is it going to cost you to trade with the broker? As we mentioned previously, this affects your bottom line, so make sure you’re on the hunt for value. As an example, anything over a 2.0 pip spread on EUR/USD is too much.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Support</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Will the broker offer you good support? Credible brokers will stress their <a href="/en/about-us/our-vision" rel="noopener">customer support</a>, sometimes, more than they’ll highlight their costs. They really want to deliver the best possible service to you because you’re more likely to stay with them. Loyalty repays loyalty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Trading services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is their trade execution and management like? You won’t know this unless you <a href="/en/trading-accounts/demo-account" rel="noopener">test their demo</a> or check whether they’ve <a href="/en/about-us/awards-and-recognitions" rel="noopener">won any awards</a>. Either way, having a platform and all the order types you need is important, so do look out for any clues they might give you (namely awards).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Education and tools</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do they want to make you better? A broker who wants you to improve, <a href="/en/analysis/trading-strategies/why-do-day-traders-fail" rel="noopener">wants you to win</a>. That is something you’ll have in common with the broker … wanting to win. Check out their <a href="/en/education-and-tools" rel="noopener">tools and education</a> section to see what they have on offer, the more the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Legal status</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the legal status of the firm? Fairly self-explanatory. You want to go with a broker that’s a solvent Limited Company with a significant paid-up share capital to satisfy their regulators. Check their <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/legal" rel=" noopener">legal section</a> for all the boring but important information.</p>
