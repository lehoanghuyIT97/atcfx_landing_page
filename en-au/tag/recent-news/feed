										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia (NAS100:NVDA) is worth looking at again this week ahead of an important Q1 earnings call.</p>

<p>The price of NVDA is trading at $131.29 on a quiet trading day after the Memorial holiday in the US. The earnings call comes with two overhead levels in play. If analysts are disappointed, then a correction could come. Either of those events is likely to make-or-break the stock market’s rebound from April.</p>
<p>Nvidia investors will be looking for real answers from management on how much US chip curbs on China exports will cost the company when it reports on Wednesday. A recent pullback in other regulations may also open up new markets.</p>
<p>In a fresh effort to stop Beijing&#8217;s access to cutting-edge technology, the Trump administration added export limits to Nvidia&#8217;s H20 chip. The company announced that a $5.5 billion impairment charge would be expected.</p>
<p>Nvidia does not break down its sales for the H20 chip, the only product it was allowed to sell to China, which accounted for 13% of its revenue last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary question around results and guidance is can Nvidia lift sales enough to offset the loss of H20 or China business,&#8221; Wedbush analysts said this week.</p>
<p>The company posted a very positive first quarter of Blackwell sales in its last earnings release and it may be a boost for the company if those sales can cover the China loss.</p>
<p>CEO Jensen Huang recently criticised the country’s wider export controls as a “failure”, saying they had backfired by spurring on Chinese developers. He also sought to soothe investor concerns about Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, which developed a lower-cost rival.</p>
<p>“Trump’s tariffs and trade policies are blotting out many other issues right now, but this one is yet to go away,” AJ Bell analysts said.</p>
<p>“The DeepSeek product challenged the consensus view that AI required more – more chipsets, more computing and server power, and more energy – and AI-related stocks have yet to fully recover their poise. Nvidia did offer fairly cautious guidance for the first quarter, which runs from February to April, but it has had the happy knack of beating estimates for the quarter,” they added.</p>

<figure id="attachment_50399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50399" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50399" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDUSD - Daily Chart" width="823" height="523" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart.png 823w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart-300x191.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50399" class="wp-caption-text">AUDUSD &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AUD v USD has recovered from the aggressive slump seen with the initial tariff shock in global markets. The 0.65 level is now resistance for further gains and price needs to hold above the 0.6360 level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommSec bank’s Tom Piotrowski said the consensus is that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s in terms of the markets’ pricing at least – there are some intellectual arguments that would hold different positions. But nonetheless, that’s what the markets are expecting,” he said on Sky News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reserve Bank of Australia could still surprise markets at its policy meeting on Tuesday, despite widespread expectations for a rate cut. With tariff issues increasing global uncertainty, predictions are varied, with some predicting a large cut, while others expect no move. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank’s rate decision will come at 12:30pm HKT, with the press conference set for 13:30pm. The Aussie dollar has gained with other global </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the Moody’s downgrade of US debt due to deficits and spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian economy is not in great health either, after recording almost the worst productivity performance in the developed world. The Productivity Commission is investigating whether the country&#8217;s 30% company tax rate should be lowered to drive higher productivity in the workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Treasury Scott Bessent played down the recent US debt downgrade, saying it was “a lagging indicator”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on CNN, he blamed the prior administration of Joe Biden. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t get here in the past 100 days,” he said. “It’s the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited, 6.7 percent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren’t in a recession, not in a war”.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTI crude oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is trading at roughly $63.25 as of Wednesday&#8217;s Asian trading session, having risen due to decreased US-China trade tensions, which have lessened concerns of an economic recession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend in Switzerland, the US and China agreed to significant tariff reductions. US President Donald Trump agreed to lower additional tariffs on Chinese imports imposed in April of this year from 145% to 30%. In return, China will reduce duties on US imports from 125% to 10%. These lower tariff rates will be in effect for 90 days. This temporary reduction in tariffs between the world&#8217;s two largest oil consumers has the potential to boost the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API weekly report revealed a 4.287 million barrel increase in US crude oil stockpiles for the week ending May 9, contrary to the previous week&#8217;s 4.49 million barrel decrease and market expectations of a 2.4 million barrel drop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPEC+ is expected to increase oil exports in May and June, potentially limiting price increases. Since April, OPEC&#8217;s oil production has risen more than anticipated, with a projected daily increase of 411,000 barrels in May.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Meta Platforms (NYSE: META)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the latest tech company to release its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q1 earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-48706 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/META-Daily-Chart.png" alt="META - Daily Chart" width="925" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/META-Daily-Chart.png 925w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/META-Daily-Chart-300x181.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/META-Daily-Chart-768x464.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">META &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of META is mirroring other </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech stocks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a slump in 2025, finding key support. This could mark a technical correction in the price of technology stocks and investors can compare the releases to see which company surprised the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta has launched a standalone ChatGPT competitor on Tuesday, making its most direct move to compete with Microsoft. The app has been built on Meta’s llama models and features on AI assistant and image generation, similar to recent roll-outs from Google’s Gemini and xAI’s Grok. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta’s financial results are released after the market closes on Wednesday and they will be closely watched to see how effectively the company is spending its $60-65bn AI infrastructure investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect the company to post $5.21 in earnings per share with $41.2bn in revenue, marking a 13% increase from a year ago.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next issue is tariffs and the impact on Meta’s advertising spend income. May 2 brings the end to an exemption that has shielded companies like Temu and Shein from rising costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Second-half visibility is murky, and the tariff shift may only amplify uncertainty”, said CFRA’s Angelo Zino. Other analysts believe Meta’s scale will buffer any slowdown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Meta is more resilient than peers”, said Baird’s Ted Mortonson, highlighting the company’s 3.4bn monthly users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta has managed to beat EPS estimates four quarters in a row and any uptick in monetisation of generative AI could boost the stock. On Wall St, 88% of analysts rate the stock a buy with a price target of around $707 on average.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_48662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48662" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-48662" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AMZN – Daily Chart" width="865" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart.png 865w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMZN-–-Daily-Chart-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48662" class="wp-caption-text">AMZN – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMZN is trading at $187.70 and the price has cleared a significant gap that occurred in August last year. The stock can see this as a base for further gains if the earnings are positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big issue for Amazon in the coming quarters is a tariff threat to profit margins. As tariffs were reduced to a 10% flat rate, that can still eat into the company’s profit share on all of its products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer cut its price target on the company by 15%, based on the tariff threat. Analysts revised their relatively bullish target price from $260 to $220. The company still has an outperform rating on the e-commerce firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley analysts said recently that around 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, while roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have &#8220;some China exposure&#8221; that could affect advertising spending plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite tariffs, they expect investors to be pleased with mid- to high-teens growth at AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing platform, “even if margins contract meaningfully” on the e-commerce side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Amazon to report around $155 billion in revenue on Thursday, up 8% year-over-year, according to consensus estimates. Profits are expected to be $14.7 billion, up 41% from a year ago. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could boost the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US share markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week if tech earnings are positive and the economy shows some solid foundation after the recent turmoil.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Microsoft (NYSE:MSFT)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will release its latest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday and analysts will be looking for cracks in AI and cloud growth. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48690" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="MSFT-–-Daily-Chart" width="901" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.webp 901w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-300x190.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-768x487.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MSFT-–-Daily-Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSFT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price now trades at $391.16 after finding some strong support at $350 recently. This aligns well with a double bottom formation from 2024 and could see further gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft releases earnings on Wednesday, and although the business may not be too exposed to the risk of tariffs, analysts are still concerned about economic uncertainty. Many businesses that drive revenue at the tech giant are becoming more cautious in their spending on cloud computing and AI services, analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend is expected to hurt key Microsoft products such as the Azure cloud platform, Microsoft 365 enterprise subscriptions, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Overall, analysts expect to see revenue of $68.44 billion, up 11% from a year earlier, and earnings of $3.22 per share. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley recently cut its forecast for Azure growth to 31% for the March quarter, down from an earlier prediction of 31.5%. The firm added that businesses are being more cautious about new Azure subscriptions, and warned of slower growth ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said interest in the Copilot AI assistant remains strong, but many customers are looking for further reasons to boost adoption, with discounts as high as 40%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Interest remains very high, but increasingly customers are using financial operations teams and searching for business cases to justify the product,” analysts wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedbush analysts lowered their price target to $475 from $550, but said they &#8220;remain long term bullish&#8221; on Microsoft, due to its AI upside. &#8220;It has become crystal clear to us that the monetization opportunities around deploying AI in the cloud is a transformational opportunity,&#8221; they said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock price is in good shape for a return to the bullish stance if the earnings are positive and the market remains stable.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese yuan was approaching resistance levels while traders speculate over China selling US debt.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48077" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDCNY-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="USDCNY – Weekly Chart" width="720" height="582" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDCNY-–-Weekly-Chart.png 720w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDCNY-–-Weekly-Chart-300x243.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">USDCNY</span> – Weekly Chart</p>
<p><strong>USDCNY</strong> is approaching the recent resistance level at 7.31. A breakout from the recent range could see another leg higher in the pair.</p>
<p>March GDP growth figures are released on Wednesday at 10am HKT. The figures are expected to show a 4.1% annual growth rate but traders will be looking for early signs of a tariff hit. Retail sales and industrial production will also be released for the world’s second largest economy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, investors have their eyes on the situation with the US dollar and treasuries. Chinese exchanges are said to have set daily restrictions on share sales by hedge funds and large retail investors, according to Reuters. Beijing is said to have stepped up support for its stock markets as the trade war expands.</p>
<p>A focus is being given to the decoupling of US treasuries with China thought to be dumping US debt and buying the yuan. Data on debt sales are not immediately available and traders are left to speculate.</p>
<p>The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also hinted at outright purchases by the department, rather than the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>China is thought to have been intervening in the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FX market</a>, ordering local banks to sell dollars and buy yuan. Last week saw the offshore yuan plunge to a record low against the dollar, while the domestic yuan is also falling. China is looking to devalue the yuan and make its products cheaper, without doing it too rapidly.</p>
<p>The dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency status could also be tested if foreign nations dump the country’s debt. The pause in tariffs for 90 days was meant to arrest a recent slide but fears still remain.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen a much slower pace of selloff in the renminbi than you’d expect, given the size of the shock to their system, so there’s clearly some sort of smoothing going on in the FX market, and to do that a central bank has to sell the US Treasuries and others to fund that FX intervention,” Mizuho bank analysts said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suffered badly from the tariff trade wars and traders are now looking for the price bottom.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47935" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USOIL-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USOIL - Daily Chart" width="704" height="591" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USOIL-Daily-Chart.png 704w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USOIL-Daily-Chart-300x252.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USOIL &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USOIL price has plunged below the key $65.23 level and is looking for a base around the $57.50 level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices have suffered after Donald Trump’s tariffs on China, the world’s largest market for crude, which were met with retaliatory tariffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uncertainty over trade flows has added to slower demand on economic slowdowns across the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, US crude inventories rose by 2.6 million barrels in the week to April 4, the Energy Information Administration reported. That was nearly double the expectations of a Reuters poll for a 1.4-million-barrel rise. The market is still struggling with higher inventory and sluggish demand. The Keystone oil pipeline from Canada to the United States has also remained shut on Wednesday following an oil spill near North Dakota.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment bank Goldman Sachs has moved recently to reduce its price outlook for oil prices. The US bank cut its 2026 average price forecast by $4 for UKOIL to $58 a barrel and USOIL to $55.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs now expects oil demand to grow by 300,000 barrels per day in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 600,000. A 400,000 bpd increase is expected in 2026. The bank has attributed the reduction in demand growth to the negative influence of a weaker GDP, which outweighs support from a weaker dollar and lower oil prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oil prices would likely exceed our forecast if the Administration were to reverse tariffs sharply and deliver a reassuring message to markets, consumers, and businesses,&#8221; Goldman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oil price downturn also puts pressure on the finances of Gulf nations with Saudi Arabia said to need $90 per barrel to balance its fiscal budget. &#8220;The deficits on the fiscal side that we&#8217;re likely to see in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries, especially big countries like Saudi Arabia, are going to be pretty significant,&#8221; Goldman Sachs&#8217; Farouk Soussa told CNBC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous times, that could’ve led to OPEC action but the group seems to have lost the ability to pull production in order to get prices higher and a wave of economic pressures is adding to the mix.</span></p>

<p>According to Mohammed Shanti, ATFX&#8217;s Head of Market Research &amp; Analysis, the US stock market had a strong start in 2025 but now faces mounting risks.

He also provides a GBPUSD outlook for 2025 and discusses Japan’s economic struggles, where inflation and Bank of Japan rate hikes have strengthened the yen. Jessica Lin, ATFX Global Market Analyst (Asia Pacific), projects gold’s continued rise, driven by central bank demand and Federal Reserve rate cuts, with silver following a similar trend.</p>
<p>Gab Santos, ATFX Market Analyst (Philippines), projects lower oil prices in 2025 amid Trump’s trade policies and OPEC+ production cuts. Gabi Dahduh, ATFX Senior Market Analyst (MENA), explores how cryptocurrencies are reshaping global finance, particularly in economic warfare.
