<p style="text-align: center;">USOIL &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw a sharp plunge to $56 at the height of the market’s tariff panic. A recovery to $63 has the September low of $65.25 as resistance for further gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices were higher on Friday but still under pressure as a potential OPEC+ output increase and a possible ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war raised supply expectations. The United States and Russia are moving toward an end to the war in Ukraine, but parts of a peace deal remain to be agreed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A halt to Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine could see sanctions eased and a return of oil to global markets. Russia is a member of the OPEC+ group and a ceasefire could see the group abandon production hikes in order to further boost prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he was ready to travel to Europe for talks on its nuclear program and that could also see sanctions reduced on Iran. The demand outlook is still an issue with weak economic growth and recent tariffs adding stress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are increasing prices and cutting financial guidance due to higher costs from the trade war, which has also upset global supply chains. In the UK, the top energy firms reporting their earnings this week are expected to show losses of $4 billion from the tariff turmoil. BP will release its earnings on Tuesday, while Shell announces profits on Friday. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slipped around 1% on Monday as progress in nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran eased concerns about potential supply disruptions from the major Middle Eastern oil producer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brent crude futures dropped by 70 cents, or 1.03%, to $67.26 a barrel as of 0030 GMT, following a 3.2% gain on Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell by 68 cents, or 1.05%, to $64 a barrel, after rising 3.54% in the previous session. It’s worth noting that Thursday was the last settlement day of the week due to the Good Friday holiday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday, Iran’s foreign minister announced that Tehran and Washington had agreed to start drafting a framework for a potential nuclear agreement, with a U.S. official describing the talks as having made “very good progress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This diplomatic momentum comes shortly after Washington imposed additional sanctions, including measures targeting a China-based teapot refinery accused of processing Iranian crude. The move adds further pressure on Iran amid ongoing negotiations. (&#8220;Teapot&#8221; refers to smaller, independent refineries in the industry.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, optimism over a possible U.S.-EU trade agreement and worries about tighter Iranian oil supply drove both Brent and WTI up by about 5%—marking their first weekly gains in three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In parallel geopolitical developments, Russia and Ukraine accused each other on Sunday of violating a one-day Easter ceasefire announced by President Vladimir Putin. Both sides reported hundreds of ceasefire breaches, while the Kremlin confirmed no plans to extend the truce.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crude oil prices</a> climbed over $1 on Friday following comments by US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who suggested Washington may halt Iran’s oil exports to pressure Tehran into resuming talks over its nuclear program.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47986" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/co1_com-e1744598152771.png" alt="brent crude oil chart" width="1500" height="990" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/co1_com-e1744598152771.png 1500w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/co1_com-e1744598152771-300x198.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/co1_com-e1744598152771-1024x676.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/co1_com-e1744598152771-768x507.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>Brent crude futures settled at $64.76 per barrel, gaining $1.43 or 2.26%. Meanwhile, US WTI crude ended the session at $61.50 per barrel, also rising by $1.43 or 2.38%.</p>
<p>Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, noted that “a strict crackdown on Iranian crude exports would tighten global supply,” though he added that China is likely to keep importing oil from Iran despite international sanctions.</p>
<p>Wright’s remarks helped lift oil prices after a turbulent week of trading, largely driven by new tariff measures introduced by US President Donald Trump. The increased trade tensions have forced market participants to reassess geopolitical risks in the energy sector. “The US emerging as a geopolitical risk is a new dynamic,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital. “This could reset the global energy landscape in a way similar to the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”</p>
<p>In a retaliatory move, China announced on Friday that it would raise tariffs on US goods to 125%, effective Saturday. This followed Trump’s decision earlier in the week to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%.</p>
<p>Although Trump postponed the implementation of certain tariffs on other trade partners for 90 days, the escalating US-China trade war is expected to hamper global trade flows, disrupt supply chains, and slow economic activity—factors that could weigh on global oil demand.</p>
<p>Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, commented, “Even with some tariffs being delayed—excluding those against China—the market had already absorbed the damage, and oil prices remain under pressure to find stability.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) warned that sustained tariff tensions could dampen global economic growth forecasts, subsequently lowering oil demand projections for both 2025 and 2026.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters poll, China’s economic growth in 2025 is expected to decline compared to the previous year, due to mounting pressure from US tariffs on the world&#8217;s largest crude importer. Analysts at ANZ Bank further warned that if global economic growth slips below 3%, oil consumption could fall by as much as 1%, citing insights from senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47935" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USOIL-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USOIL - Daily Chart" width="704" height="591" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USOIL-Daily-Chart.png 704w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USOIL-Daily-Chart-300x252.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USOIL &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USOIL price has plunged below the key $65.23 level and is looking for a base around the $57.50 level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices have suffered after Donald Trump’s tariffs on China, the world’s largest market for crude, which were met with retaliatory tariffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uncertainty over trade flows has added to slower demand on economic slowdowns across the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, US crude inventories rose by 2.6 million barrels in the week to April 4, the Energy Information Administration reported. That was nearly double the expectations of a Reuters poll for a 1.4-million-barrel rise. The market is still struggling with higher inventory and sluggish demand. The Keystone oil pipeline from Canada to the United States has also remained shut on Wednesday following an oil spill near North Dakota.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment bank Goldman Sachs has moved recently to reduce its price outlook for oil prices. The US bank cut its 2026 average price forecast by $4 for UKOIL to $58 a barrel and USOIL to $55.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs now expects oil demand to grow by 300,000 barrels per day in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 600,000. A 400,000 bpd increase is expected in 2026. The bank has attributed the reduction in demand growth to the negative influence of a weaker GDP, which outweighs support from a weaker dollar and lower oil prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oil prices would likely exceed our forecast if the Administration were to reverse tariffs sharply and deliver a reassuring message to markets, consumers, and businesses,&#8221; Goldman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oil price downturn also puts pressure on the finances of Gulf nations with Saudi Arabia said to need $90 per barrel to balance its fiscal budget. &#8220;The deficits on the fiscal side that we&#8217;re likely to see in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries, especially big countries like Saudi Arabia, are going to be pretty significant,&#8221; Goldman Sachs&#8217; Farouk Soussa told CNBC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous times, that could’ve led to OPEC action but the group seems to have lost the ability to pull production in order to get prices higher and a wave of economic pressures is adding to the mix.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oil has been rising from recent lows as traders factor in the potential for reduced supply.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47237" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USOIL-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="USOIL – Daily Chart" width="840" height="580" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USOIL-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 840w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USOIL-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x207.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USOIL-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">USOIL – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USOIL</a> is now looking for support once more at the 2024 low near $65. The price is now looking for a move above $70 to secure this level as a medium-term low.</p>
<p>The US Treasury announced another round of Iran-related sanctions, which also targeted an independent Chinese refiner and other entities involved in supplying Iranian crude oil to China. The market got the message that Chinese companies, the largest buyers of Iranian oil, are not immune to sanctions pressure from the US.</p>
<p>It was Washington&#8217;s fourth round of sanctions against Tehran since President Trump promised &#8220;maximum pressure&#8221; and pledged to drive Iran&#8217;s oil exports down to zero. The tightening sanctions regime will probably keep some market participants more cautious in the future about dealing with Iranian firms and threatens to limit global supply.</p>
<p>Analysts at ANZ Bank said they expect a 1 million barrels per day (bpd) reduction in Iranian crude oil exports because of tighter sanctions. Iranian crude oil exports were above 1.8 million bpd in February.</p>
<p>Oil prices were also helped by an OPEC+ plan among seven of its members to cut output further to compensate for producing higher levels than previously agreed. The plan would mean monthly cuts of between 189,000 bpd and 435,000 bpd until June 2026.</p>
<p>OPEC+ said earlier this month that eight of its members would proceed with a monthly increase of 138,000 bpd from April. The goal is to reverse some of the 5.85 million bpd of output cuts agreed in 2022 to support the market.</p>
<p>Oil market participants will want to see proof that Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Russia are complying with the planned cuts before oil prices are boosted further. Kazakhstan&#8217;s oil output reached a record high in March, following oilfield expansion.</p>
<p>Oil company shares could represent value if the price of crude can hold this level as a low.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the US benchmark, rose to $67.40 per barrel during Thursday&#8217;s early Asian session. This increase follows a rally driven by tighter-than-expected US oil inventories. However, gains may be capped due to concerns over a potential US economic slowdown and the impact of tariffs on global economic growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Crude Oil Inventories Rise</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), crude oil stockpiles in the US increased by 1.448 million barrels last week, which was less than the market consensus of a 2.1 million barrel rise. Despite this increase, gasoline and diesel draws were larger than expected, indicating stronger demand and potentially supporting higher </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic Concerns and Tariffs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the positive inventory data, fears of a US economic slowdown and the effects of President Trump&#8217;s tariffs on imports could limit further price increases. The tariffs are expected to increase costs for businesses, boost inflation, and erode consumer confidence, which could ultimately drag the WTI price down. Additionally, new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, including those from major suppliers like Canada and Mexico, are set to take effect, further complicating the economic outlook.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPEC+ has moved to cut production as US President Donald Trump seeks to cut gasoline prices in the country. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46312" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USOIL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="USOIL – Daily Chart" width="796" height="580" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USOIL-–-Daily-Chart.png 796w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USOIL-–-Daily-Chart-300x219.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USOIL-–-Daily-Chart-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USOIL – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of USOIL has reversed a potential move back above the $70 level and is pointing back toward the support at $68. Oil has already been on a rollercoaster in 2025 with a sharp rally in January that faded. That has led to repeated attempts from bulls to regain the bullish tone but it has still not had a lasting effect. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crude oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had started the week on a positive note after the latest economic update from China, which showed manufacturing activity growing at the fastest pace in three months in February. Investors have been waiting for signs that oil demand can recover in China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was a reverse in price as traders reacted to tariff threats and news from OPEC+ that they will cut production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced an initial agreement to begin increasing crude production globally. OPEC has had trouble convincing its own members to adhere to previous agreements.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to OPEC’s announcement, the oil group is due to begin a “gradual and flexible” increase of voluntary production caps in April, but added that it is entirely dependent on a positive global growth outlook and “healthy market fundamentals”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in oil output comes after Trump called on OPEC countries to “cut the price of oil”. His administration has been engaged with Saudi Arabia and the president’s first call after his inauguration was said to be with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USOIL – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><b>USOIL</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is in a tight range as it looks for the next breakout and direction. There is resistance at the $73-74 level and support ahead of $70. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were higher on Wednesday, marking a three-day winning streak, after disruptions in oil supplies in the US and Russia. Oil traders are also focused on the details of peace talks on Ukraine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia reported that the flow of oil through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), the main oil export route from Kazakhstan, had been reduced by 30-40% on Tuesday after a Ukrainian drone attack. According to Reuters, a 30% reduction in flow would mean a loss of 380,000 barrels per day of market supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, frosts in the United States threatened supply with the US The North Dakota Pipeline Authority estimating that production in the state could drop by up to 150,000 bpd due to cold weather. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian oil supply could increase in the coming weeks or months if ongoing peace talks with Ukraine lead to a breakthrough. The recent price action of oil could be hurt by further supply after prices rose sharply in January, but then slumped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A build in US crude oil inventories is likely to have continued for a fourth consecutive week, with gasoline unchanged, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. Commercial crude stockpiles are expected to have risen by 2.4 million barrels to 430 million barrels in the week ended February 14, according to the survey. Eight expect an increase and two predict a decline, with predictions in a range of a build of 6.6 million barrels to a drop of 1.4 million barrels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oil price needs a positive catalyst to get further away from the support near $70 and inventories and Ukraine peace talks will be a driver in the near-term.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-44517 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/USOIL-–-Weekly-Chart.jpg" alt="USOIL – Weekly Chart" width="718" height="589" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/USOIL-–-Weekly-Chart.jpg 718w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/USOIL-–-Weekly-Chart-300x246.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">USOIL – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price of USOIL</a> has rallied from a base near $67 and has moved above $74 on the weekly level. That could set up further gains this week and potential short-covering.</p>
<p>Energy executives surveyed by the Dallas Federal Reserve said they have become mildly optimistic about business activity improving but with oil prices to remain stagnant this year.</p>
<p>Executives from 124 oil and gas firms said they expect WTI crude oil to cost $69 a barrel this summer and $71 at year-end. The policy from mid-December may turn out to be wrong, and the lower underlying holding oil may be shaken off.</p>
<p>Oil prices were boosted by a New Year&#8217;s address from Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, who gave traders optimism about demand in the year ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;China just is unceasing at this point in terms of their announcements about trying to stoke economic activity, and the market&#8217;s taking note,&#8221; said John Kilduff at Again Capital.</p>
<p>China announced some new measures to boost growth this week, including a surprise move to raise wages for government workers and a sharp increase in funding from ultra-long treasury bonds. The additional funding will be used to spur business investment and consumer-driven initiatives.</p>
<p>Oil is gaining further support from an expected increased demand for heating oil after forecasts for colder weather over the winter season.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oil demand is likely benefiting from cold temperatures across Europe and the US,&#8221; said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. Snow has hit parts of Europe and the UK as the new year arrived and could deplete energy reserves.</p>
<p>Incoming President Donald Trump may overturn a decision by President Biden to ban new oil and gas fields but may have added to supply fears.</p>
<p>The coming week will test the recent rally in oil, and the target ahead would be a move through $75 to open up the $80-83 cycle highs.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43950" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USOIL-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="USOIL - Weekly Chart" width="694" height="607" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USOIL-Weekly-Chart.png 694w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USOIL-Weekly-Chart-300x262.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USOIL &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong rally last week in oil has the price back above the $70 level and could mount a further rally. The first resistance level comes in around $75.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surge came after the weekly report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) revealed that US stockpiles plunged to just 22.9 million barrels, the lowest level since 2007. Oil traders will now put their focus back on the latest forecasts from OPEC, which downwardly revised global Oil demand by 210,000 barrels per day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Energy Information Administration (EIA) report said that stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, plunged by the most since early September after a 1.3 million barrel drawdown. Lower imports from Canada likely added to the drawdown, Bloomberg reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OPEC+ alliance is looking at postponing planned production increases next year amid weak demand and competing production from non-allied countries that could keep oil prices stagnant through 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight OPEC members had planned to restore 2.2 million barrels per day in previous production cuts from January 1. However, analysts now believe that they could delay these increases for another three months while monitoring demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices have remained subdued after weak demand from China continued due to a weaker economy. A rally on stimulus measures faded as with other markets later this year. Global tensions continue to be a threat and could add to any rally if a low develops.</span></p>
