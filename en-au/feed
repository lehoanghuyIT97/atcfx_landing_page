										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fell over 0.50% on Monday due to decreased safe-haven demand after US President Trump delayed EU tariffs. Low trading volumes persisted with UK and US markets closed. XAU/USD is at $3,336. Market sentiment improved after Trump&#8217;s Sunday tariff postponement until July 9, causing downward pressure on gold after a 4.86% weekly gain (largest since April 7).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, XAU/USD bullish trend continued as Trump pressured Apple to manufacture in the US (threatening 25% tariffs) and suggested potential 50% EU tariffs, driving gold from $3,287 to $3,365. Despite the recent pullback, gold is expected to rise. China&#8217;s net gold imports via Hong Kong significantly increased in April. Geopolitical tensions remain due to Russia&#8217;s continued attacks on Ukraine, met with a strong reaction from Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&#8217;s US economic data includes April Durable Goods Orders, FOMC minutes, Q1 2025 GDP (second estimate), and the Core PCE Price Index.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downward Pressure on Gold Despite Economic Concerns</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices experienced downward pressure despite stable US Treasury yields and a decline in real yields. While concerns regarding US fiscal policy, including Moody&#8217;s recent credit rating downgrade and a significant increase in the debt ceiling, presented a potentially supportive backdrop, increased risk appetite among investors weighed on the precious metal&#8217;s valuation. A marginal depreciation of the US Dollar Index (DXY) to 99 provided limited countervailing support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XAU/USD Technical Outlook</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices slightly retreated as traders took profits amid low US liquidity due to a holiday. Trump&#8217;s trade policy uncertainty may cause volatility to resume. Technically, gold&#8217;s bull trend holds. A daily close above $3,300 could lead to testing $3,365, then $3,400, the $3,438 May 7 high, and the $3,500 ATH. Conversely, falling below $3,300 may trigger a move to the $3,204 May 20 low and the $3,199 50-day SMA.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailer </span><b>PDD Holdings (NAS100:PDD)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> releases first quarter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday with the stock trying to reclaim the 2025 highs. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50576" style="width: 754px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50576" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PDD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="PDD - Daily Chart" width="754" height="502" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PDD-Daily-Chart.png 754w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PDD-Daily-Chart-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50576" class="wp-caption-text">PDD &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PDD shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trades at $119.24 with the 2025 highs set at the $133.34 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PDD’s first-quarter earnings report could serve as the next big driver for its share price, Morgan Stanley analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retailer is set to release its financial results on Tuesday morning and the investment bank sees potential upside depending on the strength of its online marketing services (OMS) revenue and profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe its 1Q25 OMS revenue growth and non-GAAP net profit could be the next share price catalyst,” analysts wrote. Morgan Stanley expects OMS revenue to rise 11% year over year, marking an 18% growth in gross merchandise volume (GMV), and non-GAAP net profit to hit 28 billion yuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts also see the company continuing to gain market share in the domestic market, forecasting GMV growth that outpaces the broader industry’s 6% expansion. However, they added that OMS revenue is likely to grow at a slower rate than GMV, as the company increases subsidies to merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley outlines three potential scenarios for the quarter, with a base case, which it assigns a 60% probability, is for OMS revenue growth of 11–14% and profit of 27–28 billion yuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more bullish outcome would be stronger revenue growth and profit of up to 30 billion yuan, which could boost the share price by 5–15%. However, weaker numbers than these scenarios could see the stock down more than 10%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite paying larger subsidies to merchants and consumers, Morgan Stanley believes some of the pressure could be “partially offset by less spending in Temu US”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2025 price high could come into play this week for PDD stock.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle maker </span><b>Li Auto (NAS100:LI)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> releases </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week with the stock hovering below recent highs. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50575" style="width: 916px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50575" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LI-Daily-Chart.png" alt="LI - Daily Chart" width="916" height="541" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LI-Daily-Chart.png 916w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LI-Daily-Chart-300x177.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LI-Daily-Chart-768x454.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50575" class="wp-caption-text">LI &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of LI is trading at $28.91 and the resistance ahead is the 2024 high at $41.08. Just above that level we have the 2025 high around $33. These are the key obstacles for the current bullish activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Auto is releasing its first quarter results on Thursday after the stock has jumped by more than 50% from its 2025 lows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect the latest results to show that Li Auto’s revenue dropped slightly in the first quarter to CNY 25 billion, with earnings per share expected to fall from CNY 1.21 to CNY 0.64.  Li Auto is then expected to continue its growth trajectory, with analysts expecting annual revenue at the firm to be CNY 169 billion, up by 17.2% from last year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent reports showed that deliveries are still growing, with 33,939 vehicles dispatched in April, up by 31% from the same period last year. The figure is also above the March deliveries of 36,674.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts are majorly bullish on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Auto stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price, with an average target of $33.77, up from the current $28.9. With Tesla floundering across the globe, positive earnings results could see further investment interest flowing to Li stock. A breach of the $133 resistance level could get up to $150 if the general market remains positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research firm Rho Motion predicts that China’s subsidies and the new EU emissions targets will see global EV and plug-in hybrid sales to increase by more than 17% in 2025, reaching 20 million units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the US market, a lot of uncertainty has obviously hit the market in the last year or so, and we are expecting reduced EV forecasts, However, the shift to electric vehicles is still very much happening, and we will still see growth over the next decade,” a Rho report said.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_50541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50541" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50541" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GBPJPY – Daily Chart" width="990" height="589" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 990w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x178.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GBPJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x457.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50541" class="wp-caption-text">GBPJPY – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBP v JPY has resistance at the 194.71 level which has been an obstacle for the pair in January and April. Another failure at that failure could see a correction in the pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British retail sales numbers are released on Friday at 2pm HKT with economists expecting to see a monthly dip of 0.4% to 0.2%. However, the yearly figure is expected to show an increase from 2.6% to 4.5%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British pound was trading close to its highest level against the US dollar since 2022 as hotter inflation and improving relations with Europe and the US continued to support the currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The trade deals are generally good news for the pound,&#8221; said ING FX strategist Francesco Pesole. &#8220;We still think the pound is in a pretty good position&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest inflation readings could also stall any future rate cuts from the Bank of England and support the pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BoE&#8217;s chief economist Huw Pill said this week that a quarterly pace of cuts was &#8220;too rapid&#8221; given still strong wage pressures on inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of dissent building at the Bank of England,&#8221; ING&#8217;s Pesole added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country’s central bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25% on May 8 in a three-way split vote, with two members favouring a bigger cut, and two &#8211; including Pill – deciding a hold was the best option. The recent positive sentiment should continue to boost the prospects for the British pound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Japan&#8217;s government downgraded its assessment of the global economy on Thursday due to the uncertainty over trade policy. In its monthly economic report for May, the government lowered its outlook for the US economy for the first time in nearly three years to say its expansion was moderating.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">German stock market (GER 30)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has continued its strong recovery and has hit new highs. However, some slowing momentum in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/mt4-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MACD indicator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a warning. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50542" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50542" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="GER 30 – Daily Chart" width="640" height="651" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart.png 640w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GER-30-–-Daily-Chart-295x300.png 295w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50542" class="wp-caption-text">GER 30 – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the GER 30 now trades at 24,040 after a slump to as low as 19,000 in April. The push to new highs has occurred alongside a declining MACD indicator which would raise caution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The German stock market continues to move strongly despite a weak economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent data showed German wage growth has eased significantly, and economic weakness suggests future bonuses will likely be much lower than in the past, according to the Bundesbank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-quarter negotiated wages rose just 0.9% from a year ago, compared to a 5.8% gain at the end of 2024, according to the central bank’s report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany’s economy is expected to stagnate this year as the country faces headwinds from  Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade threats, the government’s panel of economic advisers said Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany has Europe’s largest economy, but hasn’t seen significant economic growth in five years, and gross domestic product shrank in each of the last two years. The panel, in its first forecast since new Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office earlier this month, predicted the economy will stagnate before 1% growth in 2026. A previous forecast in November predicted 0.4% growth this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new outlook is similar to the forecast made a month ago by Germany’s former government. Merz, who took office on May 6, has announced plans to cut bureaucracy, advance digitization, provide tax breaks for companies and promote more free trade agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump’s tariff policy is increasing uncertainty and endangering economic growth worldwide,” said Monika Schnitzer, the head of the panel. But she added that a huge investment package offered by Merz’s coalition “offers opportunities for a modernization of infrastructure in Germany and a return to a higher path of growth”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders can still find some dip buying momentum in the GER 30 but should be wary of any change in sentiment from news headlines that could create another pullback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia releases earnings in just under a week on May 28 and the stock will be the hottest topic in markets next week. The stock has recovered from an April slump and is now trying to push back to the previous highs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coming earnings could be a significant event that creates the next medium-term trend for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things to consider is a soothing of geopolitical worries on trade. The US and China have pulled back from its trade war and that can create an easier climate. Nvidia has also been moving to invest in manufacturing plants in the United States which can get the company on good terms with the current President and lessen its exposure to overseas issues. A recent trade visit between President Trump and Saudi Arabia has also led to partnership plans with Nvidia and the Middle Eastern state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, would be a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. The growth driver has been higher demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia was very bullish on its early sales of the new Blackwell AI platform. That could be a factor in an earnings surprise this quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors will also focus on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding trade policies and tariffs. The Trump administration has been said to be considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules. That could be another cap to Nvidia’s potential sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stock market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remains positive, NVDA could creep toward the first resistance line noted ahead of earnings and set up a retest of the highs with a positive earnings surprise.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_50491" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50491" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50491" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="EURGBP - Daily Chart" width="646" height="546" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart-1.png 646w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EURGBP-Daily-Chart-1-300x254.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50491" class="wp-caption-text">EURGBP &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR v GBP has slumped from 0.87 in April to 0.84 and is at risk of further losses with a weak bounce. The support level below is the 0.8323 figure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s data starts at 3:30pm HKT with the release of PMI figures for Germany. A move from 48.4 to 48.9 is expected in manufacturing, with a 0.5 increase expected in services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same figures are released for the wider eurozone at 4pm, with gains expected in manufacturing. That will be followed by the UK data at 4:30pm, where a larger jump is expected in its PMI figures. That could show underlying strength in the UK economy and add to recent euro losses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK has recently been in talks with the eurozone on a Brexit reset deal. According to reports, the UK will be granted access to the EU’s £150 billion defence procurement scheme, while checks on food and agricultural equipment at the border are in line for a substantial reduction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics are calling it a ‘surrender deal,’ but financial analysis from Frontier Economics, who assessed how closer ties benefit the domestic economy earlier this year, say that the deal could be worth up to £25 billion annually for the UK. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain&#8217;s economy is expected to grow a little faster this year after a Reuters poll of economists, who see unexpectedly strong growth in the first quarter continuing. Sentiment has improved with the EU deal and a basic trade deal with the United States, which still leaves a 10% tariff on British goods but lowers duties on cars and steel.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The UK government is massively increasing spending this year. There&#8217;s a lot of money coming in and that&#8217;s going to act as a bit of a tailwind as well. Real wage growth is also still quite strong, so the economy still has some reasonable underpinnings&#8221;, said James Smith, economist at ING. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK economy seems to have more positive near-term sentiment than its European counterpart and that can boost the British pound, with PMI figures giving a chance to add further gains. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/live-chart/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange rate was lower after a weak Japanese bond auction raised fears over the country’s debt levels. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50445" style="width: 834px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50445" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-1.png" alt="USDJPY – Daily Chart" width="834" height="525" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-1.png 834w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-1-300x189.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-1-768x483.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50445" class="wp-caption-text">USDJPY – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD v JPY has been retreating again with a move to 144.30  and it is possible that the pair could move lower toward 142. The September low at 139.63 would be the bigger test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan’s bond market sentiment was hurt by the worst auction demand since 2012. The sale comes after a recent surge in longer-dated Japanese bond yields and increased volatility, partly due to the recent US policy measures. Investors were worried that the central bank was stepping back from the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan has been the biggest buyer of US treasury bonds with official data showing holdings of $1.13 trillion in March. Any problems in the Japanese economy could ultimately backfire on the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was gloomy about the fiscal situation, saying: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our country’s fiscal situation is undoubtedly extremely poor, worse than Greece’s”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan reported last week that its GDP growth shrank in the past quarter, with investors fearing a recession. On Monday, the cost of borrowing rose after yields on the 40-year bond hit highs not seen in 20 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ishiba was elected prime minister after pitching himself as a hawk aiming to curb the excesses of “Abenomics”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the US debt downgrade, the USD v JPY could be a currency to watch over the coming months as capital flows could change. For the moment, the yen may drop to test the lows of last September.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v CAD is trading very close to the yearly high around the 1.8776 level. The latest economic data could create a breakout or obstacle. A correction would target the 1.83-84 level first, with larger support at 1.80. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian economy will release its consumer price data on Tuesday evening and that could set up the next move with the United Kingdom releasing the same data at 2pm HKT on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK retail sector will also be in focus this week, with high street companies due to report earnings, while economic data should also provide an update on consumer activity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been some brighter spots in UK economic data over the past month, with Office for National Statistics (ONS) data last week showing stronger-than-expected UK economic growth of 0.7% in the first quarter, versus estimates of 0.6%. This was also a marked improvement on the 0.1% growth recorded in the fourth quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Kingdom has also done trade deals with the United States and Europe over the last week and will now look to capitalise on those agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separate data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed UK total retail sales rose by 7% year-on-year in April, well ahead of the annual average growth of 1.4%. The UK retail trade association said the sunniest April on record boosted consumer spending.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The sun has been shining on the high street in recent months, as the warmer weather has prompted shoppers to spend money entertaining and refresh summer wardrobes,&#8221; said Susannah Streeter at Hargreaves Lansdown.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada’s Consumer Price Index is a key inflation gauge that the Bank of Canada (BoC) closely watches when setting interest rates. Headline inflation is expected to have eased sharply, with annual CPI forecast to fall 1.6% from 2.3% in March.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Canada will also release its preferred core inflation measures, which strips out volatile price swings. The BOJ held rates steady last month after seven consecutive cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada’s outlook is clouded due to the trade war with the United States. That could get fixed over the coming year as other nations are moving to reset their trade agreements.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In forex trading, opening a position is just the beginning. For traders following a position trading strategy, learning when and how to add positions is key to maximizing opportunities. Besides simply setting a position, a seasoned position trader manages trades dynamically, building into trends or adjusting entries as market conditions evolve.</p>
<p>At ATFX, we believe that understanding positional trading techniques and applying them wisely within a solid risk management plan, is essential to trading successfully.</p>
<h2>1. What Is Position Trading?</h2>
<p>Position trading is a long-term approach where traders hold positions for extended periods, typically ranging from days to weeks or even months. The goal is to capture major price movements by aligning trades with broader economic or fundamental trends.</p>
<p>When asking <em>“what is positional trading,”</em> think of it as the opposite of scalping or day trading. Instead of reacting to short-term volatility, a position trader takes fewer, more deliberate trades based on a macro view of the market. This approach often relies on fundamental analysis, supported by technical confirmation.</p>
<h2>2. Pros and Cons of Position Trading</h2>
<p>Before applying any position trading strategy, it’s essential to weigh the benefits and trade-offs. Long-term trading can offer stability, but it’s not without challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower trade frequency:</strong> Fewer trades mean lower transaction costs and less emotional pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with macro trends:</strong> A position trader typically rides broader trends backed by strong economic narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Less screen time:</strong> Positional trading does not demand constant monitoring, offering more flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requires patience and discipline:</strong> Trades may take days or weeks to develop.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to macro events:</strong> Holding through weekends or data releases increases risk.</li>
<li><strong>Prolonged drawdowns:</strong> Market reversals or consolidations can test a trader’s conviction and capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these trade-offs helps traders assess if position trading suits their personality, strategy, and risk appetite.</p>
<h2>3. Why Add Positions?</h2>
<p>In many positional trading techniques, adding positions is a tactical way to manage capital, improve average entry price, or build into momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Adding Positions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximize profits:</strong> Leverage a winning trend by adding positions to amplify returns.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalise on favourable price action:</strong> Adding to a position when market signals confirm a good opportunity</li>
<li><strong>Efficient capital deployment:</strong> Gradually scaling in reduces initial risk while maintaining flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, without solid risk management, adding can lead to overexposure, particularly if the market turns suddenly.</p>
<p>Before placing a trade, use a <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/position-size-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">position size calculator</a> to determine how many units to buy or sell based on your account size, risk tolerance, and stop-loss level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/trader-magazine"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-45553 size-large" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-1024x256.jpg" alt="Trader Magazine-High" width="800" height="200" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trader-Magazine-High.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h2>4. Pyramiding &#8211; Adding to Winning Trades for Position Trading Strategy &amp; Technique</h2>
<p>Pyramiding is a smart way for a position trader to build on strength. This technique involves adding to a position only when it becomes profitable, often after a pullback or breakout confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open an initial position with modest size.</li>
<li>As the price moves in your favour, add smaller positions at key intervals.</li>
<li>Use trailing stops or layered risk to protect profits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why It Works in Position Trading:</strong></p>
<p>It uses unrealized gains to increase exposure without increasing initial risk, making it one of the most effective positional trading techniques for trending markets.</p>
<p><strong>Best used in:</strong> Strong, directional markets where momentum is clear and sustained.</p>
<h2>5. Averaging Down &#8211; Adding to Losing Trades</h2>
<p>A more controversial position trading strategy is averaging down, where a trader adds to a losing position as the market moves against them, aiming to lower the average entry price.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>You buy GBP/USD at 1.2500. Price drops to 1.2450, so you buy again. While each <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-au/ways-to-trade/cfd-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFD trade</a> is separate, most platforms display a combined average entry price, making recovery easier if the market rebounds.</p>
<p><strong>Risk: </strong>If the trend continues against you, losses snowball. This technique requires strict risk control and should only be used in ranging markets or during temporary corrections within broader trends.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Experienced traders with high conviction and defined risk limits.</p>
<h2>6. Martingale Strategy &#8211; Doubling Down Aggressively</h2>
<p>The Martingale system takes averaging down to the extreme, by doubling the position size after each losing trade, aiming to recover with a single win.</p>
<p><strong>Why It’s Risky:</strong></p>
<p>It assumes the market will eventually reverse. But prolonged losing streaks can wipe out an account. While it may appeal to high-risk traders, it’s generally not suitable for most position traders.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Advanced traders maintaining a high margin level and strong risk management, and even then, cautiously.</p>
<h2>7. Grid Trading &#8211; Adding Positions at Regular Intervals</h2>
<p>Grid trading places buy and sell orders at fixed price intervals above and below the market, regardless of trend direction.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a “grid” of pending orders.</li>
<li>As price fluctuates, positions are triggered and closed based on movement.</li>
<li>Profits are harvested in increments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for Position Traders?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in sideways markets. However, in trending markets, grids can lead to large drawdowns if trades are not managed or hedged.</p>
<p><strong>Best used in:</strong> Range-bound or consolidating markets, often with Electronic Advisor (EA) support.</p>
<h2>8. Scaling In Before Confirmation &#8211; Aggressive Entry Strategy</h2>
<p>Some advanced traders choose to scale in before confirmation, entering with a small position based on early price action signals.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use It: </strong>You gain early exposure and can capitalise if the trend unfolds. If you&#8217;re wrong, the loss is small due to low initial size.</p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong> Higher chance of being stopped out in whipsaws or false breakouts.</p>
<p><strong>Best used by:</strong> Skilled traders who are confident reading market structure and know when to exit fast.</p>
<h5><strong>Final Thoughts from ATFX for Position Trading</strong></h5>
<p>Adding positions can strengthen a position trading strategy too close together when guided by clarity, discipline, and market awareness. Whether you&#8217;re building into trends with pyramiding or managing ranges with grid setups, success depends on choosing the right technique and managing risk effectively.</p>
<p>ATFX equip position traders with powerful tools, expert insights, and advanced platform features to help you trade smarter.</p>
<p><strong>Trade with precision. Stay in control. And in position trading, one good entry can be the start of something big.</strong></p>
