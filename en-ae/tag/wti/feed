										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTI crude oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is trading at roughly $63.25 as of Wednesday&#8217;s Asian trading session, having risen due to decreased US-China trade tensions, which have lessened concerns of an economic recession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend in Switzerland, the US and China agreed to significant tariff reductions. US President Donald Trump agreed to lower additional tariffs on Chinese imports imposed in April of this year from 145% to 30%. In return, China will reduce duties on US imports from 125% to 10%. These lower tariff rates will be in effect for 90 days. This temporary reduction in tariffs between the world&#8217;s two largest oil consumers has the potential to boost the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API weekly report revealed a 4.287 million barrel increase in US crude oil stockpiles for the week ending May 9, contrary to the previous week&#8217;s 4.49 million barrel decrease and market expectations of a 2.4 million barrel drop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPEC+ is expected to increase oil exports in May and June, potentially limiting price increases. Since April, OPEC&#8217;s oil production has risen more than anticipated, with a projected daily increase of 411,000 barrels in May.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the US benchmark, rose to $67.40 per barrel during Thursday&#8217;s early Asian session. This increase follows a rally driven by tighter-than-expected US oil inventories. However, gains may be capped due to concerns over a potential US economic slowdown and the impact of tariffs on global economic growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Crude Oil Inventories Rise</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), crude oil stockpiles in the US increased by 1.448 million barrels last week, which was less than the market consensus of a 2.1 million barrel rise. Despite this increase, gasoline and diesel draws were larger than expected, indicating stronger demand and potentially supporting higher </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/live-chart/crude-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic Concerns and Tariffs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the positive inventory data, fears of a US economic slowdown and the effects of President Trump&#8217;s tariffs on imports could limit further price increases. The tariffs are expected to increase costs for businesses, boost inflation, and erode consumer confidence, which could ultimately drag the WTI price down. Additionally, new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, including those from major suppliers like Canada and Mexico, are set to take effect, further complicating the economic outlook.</span></p>
