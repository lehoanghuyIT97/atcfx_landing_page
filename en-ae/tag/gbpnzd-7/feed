<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPNZD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBPNZD has remained elevated above the 2024 high of 2.1905. There is some resistance ahead to further gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v NZD has a rate decision from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand at 9am HKT. That will lead into the UK consumer price data at 3pm HKT. New Zealand’s central bank is expected to deliver a third interest-rate cut in a row and signal further reductions this year to boost economic growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBNZ will lower the Official Cash Rate by 50 basis points to 3.75% on Wednesday, according to all 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank’s projections are expected to show the OCR continuing to fall toward 3%, in smaller 25 basis point steps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the RBNZ’s final meeting of 2024, Governor Adrian Orr said policymakers expected to reduce the benchmark rate by 50 points in February. Economists said that conditions had been met to reduce rates, despite the re-election of Donald Trump and the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en/analysis/trading-strategies/2025-investor-watchlist-top-5-opportunities-and-risks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threat of tariffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uncertainty breeds caution,” said Stephen Toplis at the Bank of New Zealand. “So developments in US policy making are a very good reason for the Reserve Bank not to cut rates any more than 25 basis points per meeting”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors will look to the press conference from the RBNZ that could chart a path for the next policy decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand suffered a deep recession last year, with gross domestic product falling -2.1% in the six months through September. That helped to cool inflation to 2.2%, which is near the middle of the central bank’s 1-3% target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, economists are expecting inflation to increase again this year as a weaker New Zealand currency boosts import prices. The RBNZ began cutting rates in August and plans to lower the OCR to a neutral level, which it estimates to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. After a 50-point cut on Wednesday, investors see a 25 basis point reduction in the OCR by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see the RBNZ projecting an end-2025 OCR of around 3.25% and an unchanged terminal rate of about 3%,” said Kelly Eckhold at Westpac in Auckland. “The RBNZ will likely note significant risks associated with global trade policies, although few conclusions will be drawn given the significant uncertainties”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consumer price index in the UK is expected to come in at -0.3% after a positive 0.3% in the previous month. That will take some heat from the pound but the NZD looks to be on a bearish path due to the central bank.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">GBPNZD – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GBP v NZD price is trading above the 2.20 level but a failure there would possibly see a correction start. The 2020 spike high at 2.19 is going to be pivotal in the weeks ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key data for the British pound vs New Zealand dollar was due on Thursday with inflation expectations for the Kiwi economy at 10am HKT which will test the recent fall to 2.12%. Any uptick in inflation could arrest the recent slump versus the British currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK GDP growth data at 3pm HKT was expected to show the country’s economy ticking up from a 0.9% annual growth rate to 1.1%. That will be the most important data set as Britain’s economy must support the country’s turnaround plans with a government who cannot afford to require more borrowing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any slowdown in the UK economy at this key resistance level in the pair could be the catalyst for a correction. The British economy is on course to grow by 1.5% this year after the budget gave a boost to public spending but could be blown off course if Donald Trump approves tariffs, a leading economic thinktank has said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a boost to the UK Chancellor after recent negative data, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) increased its annual growth prediction from 1.2% to 1.5%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it warned that an expansion of tariffs after the US president’s 10% levy on imports from China and 25% on Canada and Mexico, could reduce the pace of growth to 1.3%, and by more if they hit UK businesses directly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand’s dollar could be a quiet currency gainer in a changing world where economies will have to wake up to 25% reductions in revenue for key exports.</span></p>
