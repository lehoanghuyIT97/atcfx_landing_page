										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global markets are facing heightened volatility in Q2 2025. Economic warfare, persistent inflation, and evolving trade policies are contributing to a landscape marked by uncertainty. Martin Lam, ATFX Chief Analyst for Asia Pacific, notes that geopolitical tensions, shifting trade dynamics, and the rise of technologies such as blockchain and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are increasing market instability. In this environment, safe-haven assets—particularly gold—are expected to gain traction, underlining the importance of diversification and robust risk management strategies.</p>

<p>According to Mohammed Shanti, Head of Market Research &amp; Analysis at ATFX, the US stock market began 2025 on a strong note but now faces growing headwinds. The S&amp;P 500’s momentum has slowed amid rising bond yields and weakness in the tech sector, with major financial institutions divided on the index’s future direction. Meanwhile, Dr. Mohamed Nabawy points to potential corrections in European equities, driven by US-imposed tariffs on European exports. However, fiscal stimulus and anticipated rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB) may help offset these pressures.</p>
<p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Nick Twidale, Chief Market Analyst (Australia), highlights ongoing AUDUSD volatility, driven by monetary policy shifts and fluctuating commodity prices. Lucas Nguyen, Market Analyst (Vietnam), outlines challenges facing the euro, including elevated inflation risks, political uncertainty, and an unclear policy stance from the ECB. Guest Analyst Dean Chen adds that global currency markets are experiencing varied performance, with a weakening Canadian dollar, a strengthening Japanese yen, and limited upside for USDCNH due to escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>Diego Albuja, LATAM Market Analyst, examines the depreciation of USDMXN, attributing the trend to new US tariffs and diverging interest rate policies. Gonzalo Cañete, Global Chief Market Strategist, underscores the US dollar’s continued strength through 2024, despite macroeconomic challenges. He also provides insights into GBPUSD’s trajectory in 2025 and Japan’s economic outlook, where inflationary pressures and Bank of Japan rate hikes have supported yen appreciation.</p>
<p>Jessica Lin, Global Market Analyst (Asia Pacific), expects gold prices to remain on an upward trend, driven by strong central bank demand and expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Silver is projected to follow a similar path. In the energy sector, Gab Santos, Market Analyst (Philippines), anticipates lower oil prices due to the impact of US trade policies and OPEC+ production adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>In today’s unpredictable environment, staying informed is more critical than ever.</strong></p>
