										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AUDJPY exchange rate will look to recent data for support after the Japanese yen posted further gains. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46380" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDJPY – Daily Chart" width="727" height="586" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 727w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AUDJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x242.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has bounced near the 93.86 support level which goes back to mid-2024. The coming data will have to bring further buyers to hold that level after BOJ rate hike talk has boosted the yen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aussie dollar got a boost from the latest Reserve Bank meeting minutes which did not highlight further imminent cuts. In the minutes, members said the recent rate cut did not “commit them to further rate cuts”.  The RBA remains concerned about inflation even though it has dropped to 2.4% but there is also the threat of tariffs on global trade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Bullock has said that the RBA is watching the labor market, which has been resilient and not supportive of further rate cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday morning was set to see the release of the important GDP growth number for the Australian economy, with a robust number possibly adding to yesterday’s strength. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of Japan governor Ueda was also set to release a statement around the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders will keep an eye on Chinese services PMI at 9:45am, with the Trump speech to Congress at 10am in a busy morning for markets. Tomorrow will bring Australian trade balance figures at 8:30am HKT.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42902" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDJPY - Daily Chart" width="952" height="616" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart.png 952w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart-300x194.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart-768x497.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDJPY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of AUDJPY has been testing the 101.40 level and is at risk of a move to 100 which can open a deeper correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday morning brings a speech from Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Bullock at 7 am HKT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An hour later, data from Japan in the form of foreign investment, with Australian employment data, arrived at 8:30 am HKT. Australia is expected to post a lower jobs number than last month with 25k jobs versus 64.1k. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBA Governor has hinted again that excessive government spending means a rate cut is not coming. Michele Bullock&#8217;s latest warning was delivered ahead of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates for the second time this year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While US rates are still marginally higher than Australia&#8217;s 12-year high of 4.35%, it&#8217;s another sign Australia is missing out as the rest of the world reduces rates. It is also an issue because US growth is much stronger than in Australia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms Bullock also revealed that she had personally told Treasurer Jim Chalmers that too much government spending was causing Australia&#8217;s inflationary problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My reading, when I speak privately to the Treasurer, and when I hear him speak on television and radio, is that he&#8217;s fully aware of the inflationary implications, of his own policies, he needs to be thinking about that, because he &#8211; like me &#8211; understands that inflation is really what&#8217;s hurting people at the moment,” she told reporters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failure of the Australian dollar to push higher from the current levels means the yen could gain some ground over the coming sessions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be in focus on Tuesday morning with jobs data and retail sales ahead.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41181" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDJPY - Daily Chart" width="892" height="628" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart.png 892w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart-300x211.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AUDJPY-Daily-Chart-768x541.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDJPY &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the AUDJPY exchange rate is trading at 99.31 after finding resistance at the 100 level on two occasions since September. That will be an important level and further weakness could retest the support at 94</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data starts at 8:30 am HKT with Japanese unemployment data. Strong employment and wage rises would pressure inflation and add potential for further rate hikes in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will be followed at 9:30 and 10 am HKT data in the form of Australian retail sales and inflation. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been slower to cut interest rates as inflation remains stubborn down under. Tuesday’s data will conclude the high-level data for the week in this pair and could guide price into the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of Australia’s big four banks are now projecting an interest rate cut by mid-February, after NAB moved its forecast. NAB had expected rate cuts in May 2025 but have now brought it forward by three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Japan’s board members are split over their own monetary policy, meetings of the recent meeting showed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BOJ held short-term interest rates steady at 0.25% at its two-day meeting but noted improving domestic conditions, which will allow for the unwinding of years of extraordinary monetary stimulus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Private consumption has been on a moderate increasing trend despite the impact of price rises and other factors,&#8221; the Bank of Japan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Japan&#8217;s real interest rates remain extremely low. If our economic and price forecasts are achieved, we will raise interest rates and adjust the degree of monetary support accordingly,&#8221; Governor Kazuo Ueda said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shigeru Ishiba won a Japanese prime ministerial election on Friday and investors are concerned that further rate hikes and FX interventions may be on the way. Ishiba said he would clean up the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), revitalise the economy and address security threats.</span></p>
