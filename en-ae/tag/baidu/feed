<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44702" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BIDU-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="BIDU – Weekly Chart" width="781" height="564" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BIDU-–-Weekly-Chart.png 781w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BIDU-–-Weekly-Chart-300x217.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BIDU-–-Weekly-Chart-768x555.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BIDU – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly chart of BIDU highlights weakness with the 2022 lows in play at $72.53 on the US ADR. As with all Chinese heavyweight stocks, investors must ask how long they can trade at such a discount to their US peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu&#8217;s CEO Robin Li expects AI applications will grow explosively throughout 2025 and noted this in a letter to employees on January 1. He noted that the number of paying users for its digital library Wenku has surpassed 40 million and AI apps are also seeing strong user growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wenku also offers content creation and generation for users and as of November 2024, the app’s AI features attracted over 70 million monthly active users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Staying at the forefront means taking on greater risks and facing higher possibilities of failure. It means we must endure loneliness and misunderstandings, persist through trial and error, and quickly adjust and start anew when there is a setback,&#8221; said Li. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is risk as the Chinese market now boasts 200 Large Language Models but Baidu&#8217;s resilience and focus on scalable, industry-driven AI solutions may provide an edge for the stock to bounce back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock is starting to get more attention among US investment communities due to its low valuation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Baidu (HKEX:9888)</strong> is in focus on Thursday as the tech giant releases its latest </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="BIDU – Daily Chart" width="967" height="597" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart.png 967w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart-300x185.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BIDU-–-Daily-Chart-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">BIDU – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/hk-share-cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu’s shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been on a rollercoaster after the government announced its stimulus plans. The price shot up from a low around 80 to hit resistance at 116. The price has now slumped back to almost test the lows once more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street is expecting to see Baidu to post earnings per share of $2.47, while revenue is expected to rise nearly 1.5% to $4.65 billion during the quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in August, Baidu delivered revenue below expectations, although its profit beat Wall Street estimates. The company has faced strong headwinds from the tough macro environment and competition. However, the company was positive on its AI capabilities, saying that it would boost its ad business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu&#8217;s AI innovations have been offering hope, but its core businesses have been stagnant, and AI revenue impact remains marginal. Over the last two years, Baidu has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street analysts are bullish on the firm but shares have collapsed with lower expectations for government stimulus. Investors will be focused on AI Cloud revenue growth, any updates on generative AI expansion and the company’s Apollo robotaxi business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Apollo Go robotaxi unit is said to be in talks with several firms to expand into overseas markets. Baidu said this week that it has brought down the production cost of its Apollo RT6 self-driving vehicle to 250,000 yuan (US$34,525) per unit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a trade event in Wuhan, co-founder, chairman, and chief executive Robin Li Yanhong said the RT6 is now the world&#8217;s only mass-produced Level-4 autonomous (L4) driving vehicle. That could give the company an important lead in autonomous driving for Chinese customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tesla represents another technology road map &#8230; [it] wanted to go from L2 to L4, and is still working on it,&#8221; Li said.</span></p>
