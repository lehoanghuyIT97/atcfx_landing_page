										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla (NYSE: TSLA)</a> has mounted a two-day rally following its better-than-expected <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings release</a>.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-42132 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart.jpg" alt="TSLA - Daily Chart" width="783" height="613" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart.jpg 783w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart-300x235.jpg 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart-768x601.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">TSLA &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of TSLA rose sharply on Thursday after the post-market earnings release a day before. The resistance at $265 has been surpassed, and another target at the July 2023 high is around $300.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s earnings provided positive commentary for short-and-long-term during the Q3 earnings call, with 2024 deliveries set to rise on a yearly basis. That would require a strong quarter in Q4 as the first nine months have lagged the prior year. An important takeaway was that Elon Musk said that Tesla&#8217;s deliveries could grow as much as 30% next year, which is twice what Wall Street had predicted.</p>
<p>Revenues of Tesla&#8217;s Energy business also rose sharply by more than 50% year-on-year and now contribute 10% of total revenue. Tesla&#8217;s $739 million regulatory credit income during Q3 was its second-highest ever.</p>
<p>These revenues go largely to gross profits and could remain strong as other automakers scale back their EV growth plans, and they would need to buy these credits from companies like Tesla.</p>
<p>Management said the company is on track to deliver a low-cost model next year, with Cybercab mass production expected in 2026. Musk also said the company is aiming to sell at least 2 million Cybercabs annually.</p>
<p>Musk was also still positive on the delayed roll-out of full self-driving, saying, &#8220;Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter.&#8221; The new target is &#8220;next year,&#8221; and he added that &#8220;there&#8217;s no need to wait for robotaxi or Cybercab to experience full autonomy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla is also looking to start a ride-hailing service in Texas and California in 2025, which had a negative effect on Uber shares.</p>
<p>Analyst Gene Munster said Tesla&#8217;s earnings had something for both short-term and long-term investors. He sees the strong Q3 profitability and guidance on Q4 and 2025 deliveries as benefits in the short term.</p>
<p>Munster added: &#8220;The long-term investors got the golden carrot.&#8221; He thinks Musk&#8217;s comments on Cybercab deliveries, which could rise to 4 million units annually, as a key positive for long-term investors.</p>
<p>A key issue now could be the <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/financial-events/us-presidential-election-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US election</a>, as Musk has supported Donald Trump and would likely see that return with beneficial trading conditions. Musk has publicly stated that he would be targeted by a Kamala Harris administration due to his outspoken views and his purchase of the Twitter app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chipmaker Micron (NYSE: MU) is set to release its latest <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40970 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MU-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="MU - Daily Chart" width="699" height="624" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MU-Daily-Chart.webp 699w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MU-Daily-Chart-300x268.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MU &#8211; Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of MU is trading close to the 2022 high of around $97.62. That will be the key price with the earnings release after the stock slumps in recent months.</p>
<p>Micron Technology has many analysts who are pessimistic about the chip maker&#8217;s management guidance for coming quarters. However, a Citi analyst still placed a Buy rating on the stock.</p>
<p>Citi analyst Christopher Danely wrote in a research note last week that he spent time chatting with investors about their expectations for Micron&#8217;s earnings, which he said were very pessimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate roughly 80% of investors are bearish on Micron, with every hedge fund we spoke with being negative and a few mutual funds being positive,&#8221; Danely wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shares</a> of Micron are up 4.7% this year, but they have recently taken a tumble. The stock is currently down around 40%, an all-time closing high of $153.45 in June. The shift in investor sentiment came after broader semiconductor stocks weakened as investors rotated their money away from technology stocks, competition increased in the sector, and geopolitical tensions increased.</p>
<p>The PHLX Semiconductor Index has dropped 14% from its 2024 closing high of 5,904.54 in July.</p>
<p>Other analysts have also recently come up with more pessimistic commentary regarding Micron. BNP Paribas analyst Karl Ackerman downgraded shares to Underperform from Outperform and slashed his price target to $67 from $140. He expects Micron to underperform compared to the sector in artificial-intelligence semiconductors through 2025. Ackerman said an oversupply of high bandwidth memory, or HBMs, would push down the average selling prices of the company&#8217;s memory chips.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley analysts lowered their price target on Micron to $100 from $140 while maintaining Equal Weight. They also questioned Micron&#8217;s average selling price growth in the fourth and first quarters and expected the stock to &#8220;continue trading poorly unless that shows signs of reversing&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, they are still bullish on the stock, which trades 9.6 times earnings, significantly below its five-year average of 21 times. They said that the cheap valuation and the potential of increased AI demand for Micron&#8217;s products over time are reasons to buy the stock.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">AVGO – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of AVGO now trades at $152.79 and is down sharply from the June highs. There is now a risk of further weakness to the $128.78 level. Positive earnings could support the stock for another move higher.</p>
<p>Semiconductor firm Broadcom&#8217;s latest results will be released Thursday after the closing bell and will be one of the week&#8217;s most anticipated events. Broadcom stock is up around 40% this year, and analysts are positive about the earnings.</p>
<p>According to recent data, 12 of the 13 analysts covering Broadcom have &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the company. The average price target on the firm is $192.96, roughly 19% higher than Friday&#8217;s close price. However, the stock dropped on Tuesday, causing weakness in the broader sector.</p>
<p>Broadcom conducted a 10-for-1 share split this year and has continued to impress with its AI-related goals.</p>
<p>Broadcom has been a key customer for Apple in recent years despite the iPhone maker developing its chips. Cisco Systems and Comcast are among the names of its other customers.</p>
<p>The latest earnings report will come after <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/market-news/chip-stocks-wobble-after-nvidia-shares-dip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia shares disappointed</a> the market, and we could see the market react to the strength of AVGO revenue growth. Traders will be looking for chip stocks to stabilize, and the release could add further jitters to the sector if it misses estimates on growth or management guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global stock markets plunged, and bond prices surged on Monday. Growing concerns about a potential US recession drove investors to flee risky assets and bet on rapid interest rate cuts to support economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US stock futures fall sharply: <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/live-chart/nasdaq100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq</a> futures down 2.27%, <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> futures drop 1.41%</li>
<li>Asian markets hit hard: Japan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikkei</a> sheds 5.5%, hitting seven-month lows</li>
<li>Treasury yields plummet: 10-year yield falls to 3.723%, lowest since mid-2023</li>
<li>Markets price in aggressive Fed rate cuts: 70% chance of 50 basis point cut in September</li>
</ul>
<p>The sell-off was particularly severe in Asia, with Japan&#8217;s Nikkei index experiencing its largest three session loss since the 2011 financial crisis. The MSCI&#8217;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2.0%, while European futures also pointed to a lower open.</p>
<p>Bond markets saw a significant rally, with the 10-year US Treasury note yield dropping to 3.723%, its lowest level since mid-2023. The move reflects growing expectations of aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10 percentage points to 25%,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts noted, adjusting their forecast to include quarter-point rate cuts in September, November, and December.</p>
<p>JPMorgan took an even more bearish stance, assigning a 50% probability to a US recession and predicting a 50 basis point cut at the September and November Fed meetings.</p>
<p>Currency markets reacted to the shifting interest rate landscape, with the US dollar weakening against major currencies. The euro held firm at $1.0920, while the Japanese yen strengthened to 144.99 against the dollar.</p>
<p>Oil prices rebounded slightly in commodities from eight-month lows, with Brent crude gaining 27 cents to $77.08 a barrel. However, concerns about demand continue to weigh on the market.</p>
