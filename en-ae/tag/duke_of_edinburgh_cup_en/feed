										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 28, 2024, the highly anticipated The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/duke-of-edinburgh-cup-sponsorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duke of Edinburgh Cup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, London Qualifier event kicked off. As the official partner, ATFX&#8217;s institutional business, </span><a href="https://www.atfxconnect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATFX Connect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continues to lead this event that connects dreams and the future. Since first sponsoring The Duke of Edinburgh Cup in 2018, ATFX has been the global official partner of this event for seven consecutive years. This long-term and stable partnership not only reflects ATFX’s high recognition of the Duke of Edinburgh Cup but also demonstrates its commitment and dedication to charitable causes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the event, over 100 participants showcased their superb golfing skills, earning rounds of applause. ATFX joined the participants at this moment. Over the past seven years, ATFX has witnessed countless participants sweat and chase their dreams on the field, and also seen ATFX grow from an industry newcomer to a leading global fintech broker. During the event, ATFX sponsored the “Hole In One” segment. If any participant achieved this feat, they would win a BMW car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While immersing ourselves in the competition, ATFX did not forget to give back to society by participating in local charitable donations. Each donation embodies ATFX’s care and responsibility towards society. ATFX hopes that through these actions can inspire more kindness and strength, and together build a more harmonious and beautiful world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Duke of Edinburgh Cup is a charity sponsored by the British Royal Family, dedicated to providing support in health, education, and welfare for young people worldwide. As a broker regulated by a prestigious UK authority, ATFX is steadily expanding its global business footprint. The partnership with The Duke of Edinburgh Cup further highlights the shared vision and international expansion strategy of both parties.</span></p>
