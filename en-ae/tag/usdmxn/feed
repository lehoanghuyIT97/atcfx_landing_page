										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the USDMXN exchange rate has cooled from election volatility but a potential price high may mean that Mexican peso strength is not what investors expect on tariffs. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDMXN &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of USDMXN has slipped to 20.58 after some extreme volatility around the US election. There is a potential double top in play now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currency market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been active as Donald Trump said he would impose day one tariffs of 10-25% on countries such as Canada, China, and Mexico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent Trump a strong letter in response to his </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tariff threats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where she warned Mexico would retaliate with its own but signaled she would like to work with the US. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said the tariffs would remain in place until Mexico took steps to stop illegal border crossings and drugs such as fentanyl from entering the US. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If even a small percentage of what the United States allocates to war were instead dedicated to building peace and fostering development, it would address the underlying causes of human mobility,” Sheinbaum added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexico’s economic minister also said tariffs could threaten 400k American jobs. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau spoke with Trump and has called a meeting with his country&#8217;s premiers after they warned a 25% tariff would be &#8220;devastating&#8221; for the country’s workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response from the Chinese government was that “no-one will win a trade war or a tariff war”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential double top in the USDMXN also hints that maybe the idea of a US win from tariffs is overstated.</span></p>
