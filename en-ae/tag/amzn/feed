<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMZN is trading at $187.70 and the price has cleared a significant gap that occurred in August last year. The stock can see this as a base for further gains if the earnings are positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big issue for Amazon in the coming quarters is a tariff threat to profit margins. As tariffs were reduced to a 10% flat rate, that can still eat into the company’s profit share on all of its products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer cut its price target on the company by 15%, based on the tariff threat. Analysts revised their relatively bullish target price from $260 to $220. The company still has an outperform rating on the e-commerce firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley analysts said recently that around 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, while roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have &#8220;some China exposure&#8221; that could affect advertising spending plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite tariffs, they expect investors to be pleased with mid- to high-teens growth at AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing platform, “even if margins contract meaningfully” on the e-commerce side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Amazon to report around $155 billion in revenue on Thursday, up 8% year-over-year, according to consensus estimates. Profits are expected to be $14.7 billion, up 41% from a year ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic reports released this week will also be important to the outlook for Amazon shares. GDP growth figures will be released on Thursday for the US and the important </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/financial-events/non-farm-payroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFP non farm payrolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data will come late on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could boost the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US share markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week if tech earnings are positive and the economy shows some solid foundation after the recent turmoil.</span></p>
