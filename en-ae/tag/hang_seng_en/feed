<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41506" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart.png" alt="HK 50 - Daily Chart" width="1120" height="583" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart.png 1120w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart-300x156.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart-1024x533.png 1024w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HK-50-Daily-Chart-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">HK 50 &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HK 50 index</a> fell to 20.926 after being rejected by resistance at the Feb 2023 high of 22,691. The market moved very fast and stretched too far from the 20-day moving average at 19,344.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/hk-share-cfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stocks</a> tumbled 9.4% in Hong Kong for the worst day since the 2008 global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Shenzhen markets reopened with a bang on Tuesday, as turnover topped 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) in the first 20 minutes of the session. That pushed the blue-chip CSI 300 index up 10% initially. However, a sharp selloff in Hong Kong quickly dampened the mood among investors.</p>
<p>Despite the recent volatility, the CSI300 is up by around 25% since the government announced a set of monetary stimulus to prop up equity and property markets.</p>
<p>Valuations still look cheap at only 11 times forward earnings, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, and below the 20 times currently for Indian stocks. Also, at the end of August, mutual funds were at their lowest Chinese equity allocation in the past decade. Many analysts are gloomy about the prospects due to previous slowing in the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>But the real issue is that the Chinese government has committed to strong stimulus and that should start to see foreign investors return. The 10% stock market drops on Tuesday were driven by the speculative swing higher, and the market will now look for buyers to return at lower levels.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs raised their forecasts on the MSCI China Index and they now expect total returns of around 15% from current levels. Other investment banks, such as Morgan Stanley, believe the central government will soon announce a 2 trillion yuan fiscal package in the coming weeks, while a state-run think tank official has suggested something closer to 10 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>There was no mention of any further action at a press conference held by the National Development &amp; Reform Commission on Tuesday, which hurt stocks. But a large package of that level would likely lead to another run up in stocks once a floor is reached which may not be far from current levels after sharp selling from overbought conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent Chinese stimulus measures have set a potential low for the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang Seng index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41102" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HK-50-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="HK 50 – Weekly Chart" width="925" height="604" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HK-50-–-Weekly-Chart.png 925w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HK-50-–-Weekly-Chart-300x196.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HK-50-–-Weekly-Chart-768x501.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">HK 50 – Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HK 50 has rallied from another test of the support at 16,842 and the market now has a chance to move higher to the 22,764 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short covering may have driven some of the recent sharp rally in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong stocks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after China’s central bank unveiled a broad package of measures, JPMorgan Chase analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s short sales ratio as a percentage of total market trading dipped to 13.6% on Tuesday from 15% to 22% last week, Wendy Liu wrote. That brings the ratio to one standard deviation below the market average since 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is a sign that any outsized short positions have now been covered and buyers can be the dominant group in the weeks ahead. It is unlikely that shorts will return when the PBoC has drawn a line in the sand with economic weakness. Chinese authorities had looked for the market to find its own recovery but have lost patience and stepped in to support corporations and homeowners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong stocks surged for a fourth day on record trading volume, reclaiming the 20,000 level and registering the best week in 26 years after a buying frenzy. The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.6% to 20,632 as of Friday. That was the highest level since April 2023 and created a 13% gain on the week.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the best weekly performance since the 14.9% rise in October 1998 and added more than US$440 billion in market value to domestic stocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total transaction volume in the market surged to HK$445 billion (US$57 billion) on Friday, the highest on record, according to Bloomberg. Technology stocks rallied 5.8% as the Shanghai Composite Index jumped to a four-month high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have seen one of the busiest periods from our clients in recent years across Asian equities, and notably across mainland China and Hong Kong stocks,&#8221; said Paul Smith, Citi&#8217;s head of markets for Asia and Australia. &#8220;These latest measures have provided fresh impetus into the market, and we see it continuing given ongoing investor interest.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hang Seng rally has driven away short sellers and they are unlikely to return after the PBoC telegraphed further rate cuts and stimulus.</span></p>
