<figure id="attachment_50399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50399" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50399" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDUSD - Daily Chart" width="823" height="523" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart.png 823w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart-300x191.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AUDUSD-Daily-Chart-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50399" class="wp-caption-text">AUDUSD &#8211; Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AUD v USD has recovered from the aggressive slump seen with the initial tariff shock in global markets. The 0.65 level is now resistance for further gains and price needs to hold above the 0.6360 level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommSec bank’s Tom Piotrowski said the consensus is that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s in terms of the markets’ pricing at least – there are some intellectual arguments that would hold different positions. But nonetheless, that’s what the markets are expecting,” he said on Sky News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reserve Bank of Australia could still surprise markets at its policy meeting on Tuesday, despite widespread expectations for a rate cut. With tariff issues increasing global uncertainty, predictions are varied, with some predicting a large cut, while others expect no move. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank’s rate decision will come at 12:30pm HKT, with the press conference set for 13:30pm. The Aussie dollar has gained with other global </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the Moody’s downgrade of US debt due to deficits and spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian economy is not in great health either, after recording almost the worst productivity performance in the developed world. The Productivity Commission is investigating whether the country&#8217;s 30% company tax rate should be lowered to drive higher productivity in the workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Treasury Scott Bessent played down the recent US debt downgrade, saying it was “a lagging indicator”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on CNN, he blamed the prior administration of Joe Biden. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t get here in the past 100 days,” he said. “It’s the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited, 6.7 percent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren’t in a recession, not in a war”.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDUSD &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDUSD plunged from almost 0.64 to 0.5950 on Friday and that has taken the pair through previous support from October 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aussie dollar dropped through the 60 cent level for the first time since the pandemic as fears grow over its export-led economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets are also expecting another “Brutal” day on Monday for Aussie stocks, according to CommSec’s Ryan Felsman. Investors are bracing for a $115 billion wipeout on the Australian share market on Monday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are expecting to see capitulation with the ASX SPI futures pointing down by 331 points or 4.3 per cent,” Mr Felsman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If that does materialise, it would be the worst day since the first of May, 2020 at the height of the pandemic”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian dollar is often seen as a more liquid proxy trade for the yuan and it hit a five-year low against the greenback after China announced additional tariffs on US goods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a bit of a more hawkish reaction that he&#8217;s (Jerome Powell) focusing on the inflationary impact of tariffs. The US economy has been dealing with higher inflation, and because the US is the one doing the tariffs and it will apply to all imports, it&#8217;s likely to have more impact on the US,&#8221; said Peter Vassallo, FX manager at BNP Paribas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The inflationary concerns are real, and this makes sense as we think about the fact that inflation, for five years now, has been running above target&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bearish mood in the Aussie economy may be a good opportunity for traders to sell rallies in the short-term until there is some negotiation with the US leadership on tariffs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the AUDUSD is looking bearish as we approach the data and could look to test the 0.6133 level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia&#8217;s economic path is expected to bounce back from its multi-decade lows when gross domestic product data is revealed this week. The national accounts for December are due from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday and are expected to show the economy has accelerated from the 0.8% annual growth rate recorded in the three months to September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous figures were the weakest since the 1990-91 recession, excluding the pandemic. The market is now expecting the quarterly growth rate to pick up from 0.3% to 0.5%, which would mean the economy grew by 1.2% in 2024, which is well below the yearly average of more than 3.0% recorded since the 1960s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists were forced to downgrade their forecasts after capital expenditure unexpectedly shrank by 0.2% in the December quarter. The figures included a worse than expected outcome for plant and equipment investment, which led JP Morgan analyst Tom Kennedy to trim his forecast for the country’s GDP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forward-looking estimates of capital expenditure were also significantly softer than expectations, which raises &#8220;a potential headwind for near-term GDP growth&#8221;. Companies may be pulling back on commodity-related investment until they see the real outcome of tariffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour productivity was lower during the past two quarters and Westpac senior economist Pat Bustamante expects to see a decline of 1.25% for the year, with a 2.5% increase in hours worked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While the aggregate performance has been poor, it has been driven by the expansion of the non-market sector and mining,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How the non-mining market sector is performing has more direct relevance for prices and cost pressures”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the important GDP growth data will be RBA meeting minutes at 8:30am HKT and investors will be looking for any updates on how the central bank wishes to act in the coming months.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thursday session will begin after the FOMC minutes at 3am HKT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian jobs market is expected to show a gain of 20k jobs after a gain of 56.3k a month ago. The employment rate is expected to come in at 4.1% after 4% a month ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that Donald Trump&#8217;s calls for lower interest rates won&#8217;t influence the central bank to change its rate decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People can be confident that we’ll continue to keep our heads down, do our work, and make our decisions based on what’s happening in the economy,” Powell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US government data showed that inflation picked up last month, with consumer prices rising 3% in January from a year earlier. The increase means it is less likely the Fed will cut its key rate anytime soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors will pay keen attention to Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments on tariffs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDUSD had resistance at the 0.6285 level and failed with a move to 0.62145. That brings 2022 support into play at 0.6176 over the next few days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian retail sales are coming in at 8:30 am on Thursday with a move up from 0.6% to 1% expected on a monthly basis. The trade balance figures are also released and analysts expect a drop from 5.935 billion to 5.75 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Australian economy staring at interest rate cuts to help the struggling consumer, the US economy remains rigid and that has helped support the US dollar. The latest FOMC minutes from the US central bank has supported a period of caution on rates, which surprised the market again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minutes noted inflation risks remain in the United States: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many participants suggested that a variety of factors underlined the need for a careful approach to monetary policy decisions over coming quarters”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymakers added “placeholder assumptions” about policy changes under Donald Trump, resulting in an economic growth forecast that was slower, with inflation also remaining firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost all participants” judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased, according to the latest analysis. The Australian retail sales figure will play a part in the current trend as a weak print could test the 2022 lows. The trend is currently in motion with dollar strength but traders should be wary around lows that are trailing back two years.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDUSD &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of AUDUSD is trading between two support levels which marked lows in 2024 and 2022. Support below is at 0.617, while resistance for a move higher is at 0.6285. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBA meeting minutes are released on Tuesday at 8:30am HKT. Softer US inflation data for November has added to market expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to ease its monetary policy over the next year. However, according to the CME FedWatch tool, markets now expect with a more than 90% probability that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in January, within the current range of 4.25%–4.50%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to begin cutting its own cash rate as early as February, due to further signs of an economic slowdown. Traders will be looking for further clues from the RBA’s meeting minutes due on Tuesday. The central bank recently held its interest rates steady at 4.35% for the ninth consecutive meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US PCE inflation, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, rose year-over-year by 2.8%, slower than estimates of 2.9%. The monthly core inflation figure was slightly higher by 0.1%, against estimates of 0.2% and the prior release of 0.3%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia&#8217;s Private Sector Credit grew by 0.5% month-over-month in November, aligning with market expectations. This followed a 0.6% increase in October, which was the fastest monthly growth in four months. On an annual basis, Private Sector Credit rose by 6.2% in November, the highest growth rate since May 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock has said that continued strength in the labor market is the key reason the bank has been slower than other nations to commence its monetary easing cycle. But she did keep the door open for a rate cut in February at the bank’s December meeting. She said she has more confidence that inflation is falling toward the central bank’s target of 2-3%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Monetary Fund said that Australia is one of the most resilient countries in the world and could still see a soft landing in the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the latest update from the IMF, Australia’s economy is tipped to grow from 1.2% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 as real income growth and tax cuts potentially boost private consumption while public demand remains strong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Australia remains on a narrow path to a soft landing, but risks are tilted to the downside. Growth slowed in the first half of the year, with household consumption weak as real incomes remained soft,” the group board said.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDUSD &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the AUDUSD exchange rate has slumped recently below the 0.66 level. There is support for a potential bounce but moving below that level opens up support to 0.64. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are tied in a dead heat for the US election, with the leads in the swing states being key. The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/live-chart/sp500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500 index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has given up recent “Trump trade” gains as investors are unsure of the outcome.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it really is a defining moment for the United States,&#8221; said Sky News correspondent David Blevins, in Washington DC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has been the &#8216;divided states&#8217; for quite some time now. The polarisation is deep. We see in the swing states just how close the margins are”. Tuesday voting and final result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Australia, the focus will be on the Reserve Bank’s latest interest rate decision. Analysts expect the bank to hold rates steady until February, but the press conference will be important to gauge the bank’s preferred path on rate cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBA’s board is expected to remain cautiously hawkish and is likely to highlight a need for a restrictive monetary policy as updated forecasts are set to show core consumer prices remaining elevated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent trends have shown a strong labour market, stubborn inflation and a deteriorating global economy. Geopolitical strains have been an issue with North Korean troops joining the Russia and Ukraine conflict. A victory for Donald Trump could also reignite global trade issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Globally, there’s more uncertainty than usual and coupled with the domestic data, argues for caution and patience from the RBA,” said Su-Lin Ong at Royal Bank of Canada. “Top of the list of uncertainties will be the US election — both the presidency and composition of the Congress”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists will have an interest in any mention of the Chinese economy in the RBA’s commentary. China buys almost a third of Australian exports and has a large influence on the nation’s economic stability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian treasurer Jim Chalmers said recently that China’s new stimulus effort was a “really welcome development” for both Australia and the world. Chalmers pointed to weak demand in China as one of the key factors that have been weighing on Australia’s economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Australia’s weak growth, the RBA isn’t prepared to cut rates yet with Governor Michele Bullock saying that inflation needs to move “sustainably” inside the 2-3% target.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUDUSD</a> exchange rate will be in focus this week with Australian business data and US inflation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41424" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AUDUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDUSD – Daily Chart" width="757" height="553" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AUDUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 757w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AUDUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x219.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">AUDUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p>The price of the AUDUSD has surrendered the key resistance at 0.6870. The price has now moved lower through 0.6798. The next target on the downside is at 0.6620.</p>
<p>The data starts on Tuesday at 8:30 HKT with NAB business confidence data and ANZ-Indeed Job figures. Economists expect job adverts to increase by 0.4% in September, following a 2.1% slide in August.</p>
<p>Labour market conditions are an important indicator for the Reserve Bank of Australia. Higher-than-expected job opportunities could signal a pickup in job creation and wages. Higher wages would also boost consumer spending and demand-driven inflation, possibly delaying an RBA rate cut until 2025.</p>
<p>Economists expect the NAB Business Confidence Index to increase from -4 in August to +2 in September. Improving confidence at businesses may suggest increasing investment and job creation.</p>
<p>Further data on Wednesday will be the Westpac Consumer Confidence Index. Economists predict the Index will increase by 0.8% in October after a 0.5% drop in September. Improvement in consumer spending trends could boost the Aussie economy as private consumption accounts for more than 50% of GDP. Furthermore, consumer confidence is a leading indicator of inflation where economists continue to see stubborn pricing trends with inflation expectations of 4.3% in October, down from 4.4% in September.</p>
<p>Investors are currently trying to work out the chances for a Q4 2024 RBA rate cut. Analysts are also worried about the Middle East conflict which could affect the Aussie economy.</p>
<p>“For the conflict to have a material and long-lasting impact on the market, this needs to become a broader war with a significant impact on the global economy through constrained oil supply or rising shipping costs, for example, which could up-end the current expectations for a rapid rate cutting cycle,” said Ballinger Group analyst Kyle Chapman.</p>
<p>The US dollar has been strengthening as its own jobs market fares well but there is also the potential for <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/market-news/eurusd-non-farm-payrolls-safe-haven-flows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe haven demand</a> in the US dollar as markets await action from Israel against Iran which risks sparking a wider conflict.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">AUDUSD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The AUDUSD exchange rate trades above recent resistance at the 0.6798 level and is eyeing the larger obstacle at the pre-2024 high of 0.6870.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia releases its latest interest rate policy at 12:30 pm HKT on Tuesday. The RBA is unlikely to give interest rate relief to borrowers at its September meeting with Australia’s inflation rate still stubbornly high.</p>
<p>Australia’s central bank has held interest rates at 4.35% since late 2023, as it seeks to squeeze borrowing and slow inflation. The bank’s board will meet over two days starting on Monday, with the decision and press conference delivered on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The RBA says that Australia is in a different position than many of its peers, with slower progress on inflation. Further pricing data for the Aussie dollar will also be available on Wednesday. The monthly data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics may show the consumer price index falling 0.2% in August. Analysts expect an annual rate of 2.7%, down from 3.5% in July.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday evening, further data will come for the pair in the form of the latest US consumer confidence data. The market may shrug off any negative result because the latest 50 basis point cut in interest rates will take time to feed into consumer sentiment.</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve enacted its largest rate cut since the financial crisis in 2008, turning its attention from fighting inflation to protecting the weakening labour market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent rally in the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/forex-trading"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUDUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will have GDP growth data ahead on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40211" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AUDUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AUDUSD – Daily Chart" width="781" height="591" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AUDUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 781w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AUDUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x227.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AUDUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x581.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AUDUSD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AUDUSD exchange rate is trading at 0.6798 and is testing resistance from the high in early July. That level led to a sharp downturn but the pair has recovered well. The next target above is at 0.6870. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian GDP growth for Q2 is expected to show an annual pace of 1%. That would be slightly lower than the 1.1% recorded for last quarter and down from 2.1% in Q3 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judo Bank’s Chief Economic Advisor Warren Hogan said the economy now faces the “slowest rate” of “real” economic growth in 30 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the slowest rate of real economic growth since the early 1990s recession,” Mr Hogan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, this is going to portray an economy with very weak consumer spending, no growth in the construction sector outside of infrastructure and of course an inflation pulse that is still persistent and hanging around”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters are now turning against the incumbent Prime Minister as cost-of-living pressures weigh. Polls show Anthony Albanese’s disapproval ratings adding three percentage points to 54%. That is the worst level since his centre-left Labor government was elected in 2022. The PM’s approval rating dropped by two points to 41%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albanese’s faltering ratings come after the Reserve Bank of Australia said the benchmark interest rate is likely to remain at a 12-year high of 4.35% for the rest of the year. Officials are struggling to rein in inflation that’s easing more quickly abroad, where the US is expected to cut rates this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States was largely closed on Monday for the annual Labor Day holiday but will return on Tuesday. The US dollar has suffered recently after the central bank telegraphed its upcoming interest rate cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD will also face data this week with manufacturing and services PMI, leading into jobs data on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment figures in the country were sharply downgraded last month and a weak number could speed up the rate cuts and hurt the greenback. Analysts expect to see a 165k reading after 114k jobs were added last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jobs figures are sharply lower than the 310k seen in March.</span></p>
