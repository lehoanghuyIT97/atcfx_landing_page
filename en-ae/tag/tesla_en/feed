										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Tesla (NYSE:TSLA)</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continues to face problems with tariff uncertainty and brand backlash over Elon Musk’s political role. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48593" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="TSLA – Daily Chart" width="904" height="582" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart.png 904w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart-300x193.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart-768x494.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">TSLA – Daily Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla has found strong support at the election win levels and that could see a further gain in the stock price over the coming weeks as tariff fears subside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protests targeting Tesla showrooms have dented the company’s image, while Q1 results were hurt by a sharp drop in sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock was able to rally about 5% after Musk said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency to focus on the EV maker. Yet underlying issues remain as recent data from used-car listings show Tesla’s resale values plunging double-digits in March, far less than any other brand. The Model S led the decline with a 17.2% year-over-year drop, followed by the Model Y at 13.1%, the Model 3 at 10.9%, and the Model X down 7.3%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has been planning to refresh its range of models but used prices are declining due to owners not wishing to be a target for protestors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is still valued at $834 billion by market cap and Tesla remains a leader in the electric vehicle space. Alongside its cars, the company also offers energy storage solutions and operates the world’s largest fast-charging network, with over 7,000 Supercharger stations and 1,359 sales centers globally.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla is currently working on the robotaxi, its much-anticipated autonomous vehicle. The company plans to roll out its first robotaxi fleet in Austin by June 2025, deploying self-driving Model Ys equipped with safety drivers. If successful, it could cut ride-hailing costs and significantly boost Tesla’s revenue and valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s slowing sales are the big problem with European deliveries dropping 49% to just 19,046 units in the first two months of 2025. That is a problem as the overall EV market grew 24% during the same period. Analysts have blamed the outdated Model Y and heavy price cuts from rivals like Volkswagen and Stellantis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation is tougher in China after BYD’s rapid growth, thanks to cheaper models and local advantages have pushed Tesla into a smaller share of the market. Tesla once had more than 20% of China’s EV sales but is losing ground fast. Until a more affordable Tesla arrives, domestic rivals can continue to profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer confidence remains weak across the globe but Tesla is still maintaining a high valuation as investors put their focus on the Robotaxi launch this year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla (NYSE:TSLA) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have rallied strongly after testing the Trump election win level. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47298" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TSLA-–-Day-Chart.png" alt="TSLA – Day Chart" width="754" height="543" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TSLA-–-Day-Chart.png 754w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TSLA-–-Day-Chart-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">TSLA – Day Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of TSLA shares slumped to the $244.64 level that began a Trump election win rally. After slumping back to that level, the shares have risen 20% this week and will try to hold the current low. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some negativity in sales data continued as Tesla saw a -40% slump in Europe. There is some seasonality to the figures, but some owners are boycotting the company, while others have turned to protests and vandalism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla sold fewer than 17,000 cars compared to over 28,000 in the same month in 2024, with a market share decline from 2.8% to 1.8%. Another factor in the sales drop is the impending release of a new Model Y, the company’s flagship car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figures were released alongside reports that Tesla’s Chinese competitor BYD had overtaken Musk’s company in annual revenue during 2024, despite the impact of foreign tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk has been taking criticism from investors who believe he should be spending more time with the electric vehicle maker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One investor undeterred by the recent price decline is Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood, who sees an 800% gain over the next 5 years. Speaking to Bloomberg, Wood said she sees shares of Tesla climbing to $2,600 in five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our outlook has not changed,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;What&#8217;s going on right now, very short term.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment manager said she expects to see a new budget model coming soon but is more bullish on areas such as robotaxis and robotics.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk even mentioned Wood by name when describing his own bull case for Tesla at a surprise staff meeting last Thursday, when he urged Tesla employees to hold their shares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some people, like Cathie Wood at Ark Invest, do see the future,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;So what I am saying is, hang on to your stock,” Musk said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for self-driving and robots is still a while away but the stock can still recover further from the recent slump.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle maker </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla (NYSE:TSLA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is looking to get back on a bullish path after the stock slumped during the last three months.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46870" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="TSLA – Daily Chart" width="879" height="589" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart.png 879w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart-300x201.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart-768x515.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">TSLA – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TSLA trades around the $244.64 level, which marked the open after the Trump election win. The stock may try and mount a rebound here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk’s political moves have hurt the EV maker’s sales in recent months. With the political world being very polarized, Musk’s close alignment with Donald Trump has led to protests, vandalism and slumping sales in key regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla shares rallied around 40% after Trump’s election win as investors assumed that it could lead to benefits, such as a smoother path to autonomous driving. However, that has not been the case as the negatives have outweighed the positives in the first months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla has now given up all of its post-election gains and looks for support to regain a bullish tone. The main reason for the decline is that sales of Tesla’s vehicles have been falling. Automotive revenue in the final quarter of 2024 was down 8% year on year to $19.8bn. Total revenue was $25.7bn, up 2% from the previous year but below analysts’ expectations of $27.1bn. ​Operating profit also fell by 23% to $1.6bn as the company’s price wars hurt margins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upcoming global sales report on 2 April will be a key test as the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said sales in Europe were down -45% in January compared to the same month last year. There is also talk that sales have fallen in China and Australia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street analysts had been expecting over 400,000 deliveries in the quarter, but now some estimates see the figure falling below the 387,000 mark reported a year ago. For the full year 2025, analysts predict sales of about 2m EVs, up from 1.8m in 2024. That is also well below Musk’s earlier promise of 20-30% growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the 40% slump in the stock in 2025, the company’s valuation is still not cheap at more than 8X sales and a price/earnings ratio of 120. Investors are always happy to pay a “Musk premium” for the stock on the idea that the founder could surprise investors at any turn with a new technology. However, it seems that the latest surprise was unexpected with many Democrat voters walking away from Tesla.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45344" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="TSLA – Daily Chart" width="850" height="507" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart.png 850w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart-300x179.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart-768x458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">TSLA – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of TSLA has faded to the $406 level and is in danger of a move lower to test the support around $360-375.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ahead will test investor’s resolve for the high valuation offered to Elon Musk’s firm. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives is positive that AI can help the firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think 90% of what&#8217;s going to drive the stock is the autonomous and the AI future because that&#8217;s the ultimate story here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The autonomous piece could be worth $1 trillion alone&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a potential change to EV regulation under President Trump, Ives says, &#8220;I think the stock is actually underestimating what this is going to do to the story in terms of cyber cabs, autonomous [full self-driving] FSD robotics. And that&#8217;s why I think there&#8217;s a $2 trillion market cap&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ives adds, &#8220;Next week starts what I believe is going to be a massive year ahead&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Tesla to deliver revenue of $27.27 billion for the fourth quarter, with net income of around $2.31 billion, or 65 cents per share. In the same quarter last year, Tesla’s revenue was $25.17 billion with $7.93 billion in net income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some fears over the upcoming earnings as the company&#8217;s production and delivery numbers for the quarter came in short of expectations. That led to the first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries for Tesla.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts from Wedbush, Morgan Stanley, and Piper Sandler all lifted their price targets for Tesla stock to $550, $430, and $500, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piper Sandler believes that investors will need to wait a year for the full picture on Tesla’s path with new vehicles and autonomous driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still some challenges ahead for Tesla with margin pressure amid economic uncertainty, and competition is intensifying. The company’s US EV market share has declined to 50% from 63% in 2022, while Chinese competitors like BYD and NIO continue to catch up. In the autonomous vehicle sector, Tesla&#8217;s Full Self-Driving system remains at Level 2, requiring human supervision, while competitors like Alphabet’s Waymo have already moved to robotaxi pilots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla will have to deliver something good in the upcoming earnings to avoid a near-term correction in the stock price.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla (NYSE:TSLA) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dropped by -6% as sales dropped on a yearly basis for the first time in almost a decade. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44428" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TSLA-Daily-Chart.png" alt="TSLA - Daily Chart" width="877" height="586" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TSLA-Daily-Chart.png 877w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TSLA-Daily-Chart-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TSLA-Daily-Chart-768x513.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 877px) 100vw, 877px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">TSLA &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TSLA shares slipped to $378.77 on Thursday and are now down 22% from the high set in December above $480. The gap open from Trump’s victory is at $275.45. That would be a 61.8% Fibonacci correction from the 2024 low to high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drop in the automaker’s shares is a concern for investors as competition heats up in EVs despite the company’s price-cut strategy. Tesla sales only dropped by -1.1% globally in 2024, but marked the first annual sales drop since at least 2015. Demand for EVs decreased in the United States and other areas, leading to a drop from 1.81 million in 2023 to 1.79 million. It is also an issue for management after they projected 50% annual sales growth previously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla supplied 495,570 automobiles in the fourth quarter, which was up 2.3% over the previous quarter, but Q4 is always a strong quarter. The number fell short of revised Wall Street projections of 498,000. Analysts also noted that Tesla&#8217;s average sales price fell to $41,000 during the quarter, its lowest in four years. That could affect the company’s margins which have struggled since the price war started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla is facing issues such as outdated models as fierce competition from startups in China hits sales. Chinese rival BYD reported record sales for 2024 with a bumper December. BYD annual sales were boosted by 509,440 cars last month, marking an almost 50% year-on-year jump. With the yearly figure, BYD comfortably exceeded its sales target of 4 million new energy vehicles, bringing it up to speed with legacy automakers like Honda and Ford. BYD’s performance was largely driven by sales in the domestic space, only 10.8% of sales going overseas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla shares may see profit-taking continue after the sharp post-Trump election rally.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42843" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TSLA-–-Weekly-Chart-2.png" alt="TSLA – Weekly Chart" width="823" height="607" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TSLA-–-Weekly-Chart-2.png 823w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TSLA-–-Weekly-Chart-2-300x221.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TSLA-–-Weekly-Chart-2-768x566.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">TSLA – Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of TSLA jumped above resistance at the $300 level and now the stock trades in a gap up to $415. Many analysts are now concerned that the stock is overrated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans of the EV-maker have been surging higher by Donald Trump’s presidential triumph. The stock’s recent climb has been unstoppable as investors buy into the shares and drive “euphoric” options trading. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shares have now advanced over 39%, adding more than $300 billion in market capitalization since the election. Shares closed up another 9% on Monday alone to trade around $350.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts point to the fact that Tesla is a classic “momentum” stock, where gains and losses can snowball quickly when investor sentiment takes a sharp turn either way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk went all in on a Trump victory, so it’s understandable that the market is expecting some form of payback for his efforts, which could boost Tesla with action against Chinese car manufacturers. Tesla lost its place as the largest EV-maker in the world to China’s BYD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Options traders are betting that there will be further gains with the premium of three-month calls over puts now trading at the highest since early 2021, with sizable volume in contracts betting on a rally to $450 and above. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Trump White House will be a “game-changer” for Tesla’s self-driving and artificial intelligence plans, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. He raised his price target on Tesla to $400 from $300 earlier and estimated that the “AI and autonomous opportunity is worth $1 trillion alone for Tesla”.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Despite possible benefits from the election, Tesla stock looks overvalued,” said Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is still potential for further gains in Tesla but traders should be cautious of any correction. Elon Musk spent around $44 billion to buy Twitter, which he renamed to X, and at least $130 million to help get Donald Trump elected president. But that outlay has paid off for Musk who is now around $70 billion richer on paper with Tesla’s increase.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41864" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="TSLA - Weekly Chart" width="769" height="538" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Weekly-Chart.png 769w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Weekly-Chart-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">TSLA &#8211; Weekly Chart </span></p>
<p>The price of TSLA has slumped from resistance in the last week to $220.70 and the chart has a bearish tone that could bring risk into earnings. The stock is also very close to the previous downtrend resistance around $200 and that could be an important level again.</p>
<p>The much-anticipated robotaxi event failed to inspire investors to purchase more shares in Tesla. The event was short on real details over the timeframe and that led to a sell-off in the stock.</p>
<p>“This is still a carrot on a string,” one analyst said. “How many new investors will be willing to buy this expensive stock when the core auto business is slow and the company did not show how it will bring the rapid growth in the future?”</p>
<p>Ahead of the company’s earnings, Tesla has already published its delivery figures for the quarter, saying that it delivered 462,890 vehicles, a 6.4% increase from a year ago.</p>
<p>While the delivery numbers were below Wall Street’s higher estimates, they were the first quarter of annual delivery growth for 2024. Deliveries dipped by roughly 9% and 5% during Q1 and Q2. For Q3, analysts expect revenue to come in at $25.4 billion, up about 8% year-over-year, slightly ahead of estimates, while earnings are likely to be around $0.58 per share, compared to a consensus of $0.57 per share.</p>
<p>Tesla’s delivery growth over the quarter may have been supported by its recovery in China, where the company has faced intense competition from local rivals and slowing consumer demand. Elon Musk’s firm ramped up promotions in China, offering zero-interest loans of up to five years and upfront discounts on selected models.</p>
<p>The company does not disclose its Chinese delivery figures, but data from the China Passenger Car Association shows a 19.2% year-over-year sales increase for Tesla in September. US sales may also see a boost from promotions which ended in August, and higher sales of the Cybertruck may have likely contributed to Tesla’s Q3 performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Electric vehicle company <strong>Tesla (NYSE:TSLA)</strong> will host its long-awaited robotaxi event on Thursday: This is what analysts are hoping to hear.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41541" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="TSLA – Daily Chart" width="844" height="620" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart.png 844w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart-300x220.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-–-Daily-Chart-768x564.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">TSLA – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSLA shares</a> are trading below key resistance around $265 and positive sentiment from the event could catapult them toward $300. If analysts do not like the outlook for ride-hailing then a move to $220 would be likely.</p>
<p>Robotaxi day, officially called “We, Robot,” will be Elon Musk’s opportunity to outline the future for robotaxis. Analysts are expecting to see a prototype model of an EV and maybe a look at the app for calling a taxi and operating as a provider. One of the key selling points for Tesla was that its vehicle owners could allow them to operate as a taxi and gain an income.</p>
<p>Tesla’s event will be streamed at around 11 am HKT from the Warner Bros. studio in California and that location hints that investors may see some film-style production, such as a taxi in action.</p>
<p>Tesla executives need to “reinforce to consumers and investors that they continue to be innovators,” said Gene Munster at Deepwater Asset Management. He expects to see a robotaxi prototype, alongside talk of a cheaper “Model 2” EV. He added that there could also be a completely new model, such as a commercial van.</p>
<p>“The bar on the robotaxi is pretty high, but the rest of the stuff is pretty easy, they don’t need to roll a vehicle out there. They can just talk about it,” Munster said. The “real substance” would be a timeline for the vehicle.</p>
<p>Musk has admitted to being overly-optimistic on autonomous driving in the past.</p>
<p>“Tesla’s history is overpromise and underdeliver, so whatever timing is put on this vehicle, it’s going to be pushed back,” said Sam Fiorani, VP of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions LLC.</p>
<p>”We are still considering what promises will make it to production and what won’t,” he said.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of regulatory approval for a self-driving vehicle on the road.</p>
<p>“The fear among the general public is that they are more harmful than helpful,” at least for the moment, Fiorani said. “I can’t imagine that the average American thinks that the idea of a robotaxi is a good one, even if they are likely to be safer and eventually cheaper.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla (NYSE:TSLA) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dropped by -6% at Wednesday’s open after the company reported deliveries that were lower than analysts’ estimates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41280" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart.png" alt="TSLA - Daily Chart" width="940" height="533" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart.png 940w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart-300x170.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Daily-Chart-768x435.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">TSLA &#8211; Daily Chart</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of TSLA has hit resistance at the $264.95 level and that has blocked progress toward the higher target. The downtrend line comes back into play at $200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla reported 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced in Q3 2024, which was lower than analysts’ estimates. FactSet estimates had projected 463,310 deliveries for the quarter ending September 30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tesla doesn’t note &#8220;deliveries&#8221; in its financials, it is viewed as the closest metric to units sold and is a key figure for Wall Street ahead of each earnings report. A year ago, the company produced 435,059 deliveries and 430,488 vehicles produced, while last quarter it reported 443,956 deliveries. Growth has not picked up as expected at the company due to rising competition in China and falling sales in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter had been expecting a higher figure of 459,000 EVs for Q3 and 1.75 million for the year. Meanwhile, an analyst at Barclays had projected 470,000 units in Q3, citing global EV sales and stronger August data from China. “Our delivery estimate implies volume up ~6% sequentially and ~8% year-over-year,” Dan Levy said. “We believe a beat could drive further stock strength into Robotaxi Day”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disappointing results mean that the robotaxi event on October 10 will be a key factor in the path of Tesla shares for the rest of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedbush analyst Dan Ives expects sales and profitability to improve at Tesla. “Price cuts are mostly in the rearview mirror, removing a margin overhang&#8230;we believe gross margins should finally start to rebound in 3Q,” Ives said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P Global Mobility data reported that Tesla had sold over 5,000 Cybertrucks in July, marking year-to-date sales of more than 17,000. Deutsche Bank sees Q3 sales at 13,500 units. Although the new vehicle is only 3% of total sales, the Cybertruck could impact whether Tesla meets its total delivery target.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla (</span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYSE:TSLA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is moving higher and Goldman Sachs was touting call options ahead of the October events. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/%E5%BD%B1%E5%83%8F-e1727402755651.png" alt="TSLA - Daily Chart" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">TSLA &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of TSLA shares is now $260.50 after retaking the downtrend resistance line. The target on the upside would be $300 with some resistance just ahead around the $270 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs recently focused its attention on Tesla, highlighting some key events in October that could boost the stock. Analyst John Marshall from Goldman&#8217;s derivatives research team suggested that investors could buy call options to take advantage of potential upside price movements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events, including the release of third-quarter delivery numbers and a much-anticipated robotaxi event, are seen as pivotal for the company’s future path. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs Automobiles analyst Mark Delaney expects “the company’s technology and business outlook for Full Self Driving (FSD)/Robotaxis to be a prominent part of the event. On 2-Oct the company is also expected to report 3Q24 deliveries and production data which Mark estimates to come in-line with Visible Alpha consensus at ~460k”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman’s optimistic outlook comes after Tesla’s stock has been under scrutiny due to production concerns and competition in the EV space, particularly in China, where sales have also faltered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upcoming events could provide investors with the clarity to start betting on Tesla&#8217;s growth prospects once more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s quarterly delivery numbers next week have analysts forecasting record third-quarter sales, driven by a demand rebound in China. FactSet&#8217;s estimates suggest that Tesla will deliver 461,000 vehicles in the quarter, marking a 6% year-on-year growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Barclays raised its forecast to 470,000, suggesting an 8% annual rise and a 10% increase from the second quarter. Stronger sales in China are expected to cover for weaker sales in the United States and Europe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors were bearish on Tesla after Elon Musk delayed the robotaxi announcement. However, the billionaire founder has a chance to clear up any confusion over the prospects for self-driving taxis.</span></p>
