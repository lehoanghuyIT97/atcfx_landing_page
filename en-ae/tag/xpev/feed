										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Electric vehicle maker <strong>XPeng (<a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSE:XPEV</a>)</strong> has earnings on Tuesday that will test a recent market rally.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">XPEV – Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p>The price of XPEV has rallied strongly in 2025 to trade at $24.56. That leaves a marker at $23.68 which will act as support.</p>
<p>Analysts expect XPeng to deliver earnings of -$1.36 with revenue expected to come in at $16.11 billion for the quarter.</p>
<p>A number of research firms have been positive about the stock with Citigroup upgrading XPeng from a “neutral” rating to a “buy” with a target price of $13.70 to $29.00. UBS upgraded XPeng from a “sell” rating to a “neutral” rating.</p>
<p>XPeng has been part of a strong sales year in Chinese electric vehicles but the company is eyeing another financial stream. The stock jumped 15% after management talked about mass-producing flying cars and humanoid robots. The company is now being seen as a Tesla.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see further EV sales data in the earnings after a recent drop in <strong><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/market-news/tesla-support-tough-few-months" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla</a> </strong>sales. That may be related to Elon Musk’s political moves and could boost companies like XPeng.</p>
<p>Another boost has been the official launch of the updated 2025 G6 electric SUV in China with cheaper pricing and faster charging speeds, making it one of the fastest-charging cars in the world. The new G6 is priced at 11% lower than the existing model the high-end version has also come down in price. Charging speeds have been improved significantly, with up to 80% charging in only 12 minutes. Wall Street analysts had been expecting over 400,000 deliveries in the quarter, but now some estimates see the figure falling below the 387,000 mark reported a year ago.</p>
<p>Over the last month, Xpeng has further expanded into overseas markets such as the UK and Australia.</p>
