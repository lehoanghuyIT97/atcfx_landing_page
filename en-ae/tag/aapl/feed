<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47626" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="920" height="610" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png 920w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x199.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-768x509.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of AAPL stock failed above the previous resistance at $236.87 and has now dipped through support at $198.25. The market may look for a short-term bounce as we probe lower levels toward $170.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple stock was set for another tough day on Monday as panic mode continued in the media over the weekend. The company was sold off as new tariffs were unveiled over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump&#8217;s tariffs have affected every country that supplies components to Apple. That means Apple now has to pay more for its imports, and is unlikely to avoid raising its prices to match the strain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market also reacted to the prospect of American consumers facing higher prices, and saw high volume sell-offs ahead of the weekend. The fallout is equally hitting other technology firms as analysts look at supply chains for each sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his tariff announcement, Trump spoke about Apple and their planned investment of $500 billion in the US &#8220;They never spent money like that here,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple has spent years, and its suppliers have spent billions, trying to disconnect from China. However, the country still dominates Apple’s supply chain and that is unlikely to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading into Monday’s session, markets will be focused on news that China will impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting on April 10. The country is hitting back with its own level of tariffs and markets are likely to be on edge over the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple shares lost around 14% of their value over the past week as tech stocks continued to suffer from a lack of AI adoption and deeply overbought conditions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple (NYSE:AAPL)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is said to be considering major iPhone updates, according to the Wall St Journal. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43982" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="AAPL – Daily Chart" width="928" height="562" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart.png 928w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-300x182.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AAPL-–-Daily-Chart-768x465.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">AAPL – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAPL started 2024 with a five-month dip to around May and then began a sharp rally to $236. Price corrected once more but has now soared to an all-time high above $250. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple is said to be preparing to make major changes to its iPhone lineup and maybe some of its other products. Beginning next year, the company aims to release a thinner iPhone, with a design slimmer than the current 8-millimeter models. The updated device is also expected to come in at a lower price than previous iPhone Pro models and will include a simplified camera. Reports said the company wants to boost demand for its product offerings and drive future growth, while cutting costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple is also working on two foldable devices, with a 19-inch laptop-sized model and a smaller model that would act as a foldable iPhone. The company was said to have seen delays with its foldable technology but may be releasing it in 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple is heavily reliant on its iPhone segment for more than 50% of its overall sales. A slowdown in those sales led to a slowdown in 2024 and some volatility in the share price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also had issues with its Vision Pro product, which is a high-end virtual reality headset. That was a move to new products but the headset’s high price of more than $3,000 led to production cuts on weak demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are rumours of a more affordable version of the Vision Pro that could be powered by an iPhone. That could give the device more commercial appeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The valuation of Apple is currently around 20% higher than its 5-year average and any sales slowdown or delays could hurt the recent rise to all-time highs.</span></p>
