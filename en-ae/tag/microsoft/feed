										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Microsoft (NYSE:MSFT)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will release its latest </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday and analysts will be looking for cracks in AI and cloud growth. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48690" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.webp" alt="MSFT-–-Daily-Chart" width="901" height="571" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart.webp 901w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-300x190.webp 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT-–-Daily-Chart-768x487.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MSFT-–-Daily-Chart</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSFT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price now trades at $391.16 after finding some strong support at $350 recently. This aligns well with a double bottom formation from 2024 and could see further gains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft releases earnings on Wednesday, and although the business may not be too exposed to the risk of tariffs, analysts are still concerned about economic uncertainty. Many businesses that drive revenue at the tech giant are becoming more cautious in their spending on cloud computing and AI services, analysts said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend is expected to hurt key Microsoft products such as the Azure cloud platform, Microsoft 365 enterprise subscriptions, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Overall, analysts expect to see revenue of $68.44 billion, up 11% from a year earlier, and earnings of $3.22 per share. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley recently cut its forecast for Azure growth to 31% for the March quarter, down from an earlier prediction of 31.5%. The firm added that businesses are being more cautious about new Azure subscriptions, and warned of slower growth ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said interest in the Copilot AI assistant remains strong, but many customers are looking for further reasons to boost adoption, with discounts as high as 40%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Interest remains very high, but increasingly customers are using financial operations teams and searching for business cases to justify the product,” analysts wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedbush analysts lowered their price target to $475 from $550, but said they &#8220;remain long term bullish&#8221; on Microsoft, due to its AI upside. &#8220;It has become crystal clear to us that the monetization opportunities around deploying AI in the cloud is a transformational opportunity,&#8221; they said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock price is in good shape for a return to the bullish stance if the earnings are positive and the market remains stable.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft (MSFT) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are in focus as the company is the latest tech giant to release its earnings report. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42233" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MSFT-Daily-Chart.png" alt="MSFT - Daily Chart" width="789" height="597" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MSFT-Daily-Chart.png 789w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MSFT-Daily-Chart-300x227.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MSFT-Daily-Chart-768x581.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">MSFT &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of MSFT is testing the $430 level and that has been a pivot area for the stock since March. A strong earnings report could see the price jump above that level and test the $440 area, while there is support down to $410. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft shares have slipped from a July high near $470 as investors wound back their expectations for artificial intelligence revenue streams. Microsoft’s earnings will be similar to Alphabet’s, where investors want to see further cloud growth and also the level of spending that the company has committed to.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft is now the third-largest company in the world, with a market valuation of $3.18 trillion, after Nvidia soared to number one. The company’s June earnings were disappointing after cloud growth slowed down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the upcoming </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is released after the market close on Wednesday, investors will again look for the cloud growth outlook. The Azure segment has been a key driver of revenue for the company. Another focus will be the company’s spending on its data centre infrastructure. Analysts are worried that rising capital expenditure could hurt profit margins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure and other cloud services now account for nearly 60% of the company’s total revenue, making it critical to future growth. Azure ranks second in global market share, behind Amazon Web Services. Google is in third and will also release its earnings report this week, which could highlight competition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024, Microsoft’s Cloud segment reported revenue of $28.51 billion, for an increase of 19% year-on-year. That was driven by a 29% growth in Azure and other cloud products. However, Azure&#8217;s growth fell short of analysts&#8217; expectations in the quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsche Bank analysts said they expect Azure to post a low-to-mid 30s percentage increase for the fiscal first quarter, saying the company “needs to deliver Azure outperformance and guidance for little if any deceleration”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft management has said that increased investment in data centres are needed to meet a fast-growing demand for AI training. In the forward-looking statements of the June quarter, the tech giant acknowledged &#8220;significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns,&#8221; after an extra $3 billion was spent compared to the previous quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft will need to see a rebound in its upcoming earnings release if the share price is to return to its March highs.</span></p>
