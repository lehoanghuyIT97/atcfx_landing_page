										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese EV shares dropped this week after BYD, a leading EV manufacturer, increased fears of a tough price war. The company&#8217;s aggressive price cuts have been rattling the sector, adding to fears over profitability and competition. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_50725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50725" style="width: 729px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50725" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="NIO – Daily Chart" width="729" height="529" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart.png 729w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIO-–-Daily-Chart-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50725" class="wp-caption-text">NIO – Daily Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIO (NYSE:NIO) shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were lower on the news with a move from the $4 level to prices under $3.80. This is a key level for the stock as a failure could move further down toward the $3 lows of April. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of Geely, Li Auto, and Xpeng saw declines of 7%, 5%, and 4% respectively, after BYD announced significant price reductions on 22 models, including the entry-level Seagull EV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price cuts are a strategic move by BYD to maintain its market leadership,&#8221; said analysts at Financial Times. &#8220;However, this aggressive pricing strategy could lead to a prolonged price war, affecting the entire industry&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a clear indication that the price war in the Chinese EV market is heating up,&#8221; said an analyst from South China Morning Post. &#8220;BYD&#8217;s move is likely to force other manufacturers to follow suit, leading to a potential race to the bottom&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price war raises concerns about the profitability of rival Chinese EV manufacturers, especially those that are targeted at higher-end consumers, such as NIO. BYD&#8217;s latest profit forecast fell short of analyst’s expectations, highlighting the challenges created by the intense competition in electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent setback, BYD was optimistic about its long-term prospects. In a statement released after the earnings, the company emphasized its commitment to innovation and market leadership. The latest price cuts by BYD may also be an effort to hit Tesla while it has already been struggling.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price war could lead to a shakeout in the Chinese EV market,&#8221; said an analyst from NBC Los Angeles. &#8220;Only the most competitive and innovative companies will be able to withstand the pressure&#8221;.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle maker </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/shares-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will release its latest earnings on Tuesday after some recent sales gains.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46698" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIO-–-Weekly-Chart.png" alt="NIO – Weekly Chart" width="863" height="594" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIO-–-Weekly-Chart.png 863w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIO-–-Weekly-Chart-300x206.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIO-–-Weekly-Chart-768x529.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">NIO – Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIO stock has found itself in a range between $3.70 and $7 in the US ADR. The $3.70 support is closest but an </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/earning-season-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surprise could see some sharp upward momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, CNBC reported that sales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models made up 20% of all new car and truck sales for the first time in 2024. Motor Intelligence said that more than 3.2 million electrified vehicles were sold last year, including 1.9 million hybrid vehicles and 1.3 all-electric vehicles for the US market. Chinese EV sales also saw a bumper year and that helped NIO to a record annual sales number, delivering 72,689 vehicles, for a 45.2% increase year-over-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At NIO Day in December 2024, the company launched ET9, its flagship electric car that showcases advanced technology in multiple areas, including intelligent driving. NIO plans to start deliveries of the ET9 by the end of March. Additionally, the company introduced FIREFLY as its new high-end electric car brand, which is expected to be launched in April 2025. Both of these new models could see another strong year in sales for NIO and the stock price may see a recovery with an earnings surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts expect Nio to post a loss of 34 cents per share vs. a 39-cent loss a year ago, according to FactSet. They also see revenue at the company rising 17.9% to $2.802 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nio continues to work on a turnaround strategy with improving sales and more affordable vehicles. Some analysts say Nio&#8217;s venture into mass-market and budget brands may hurt its premium image, but the company is set on targeting a &#8220;broader global market&#8221; with its new models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe has pushed back on Chinese vehicles saturating the market and Donald Trump is unleashing heavy tariffs, so it is not a great environment to see global sales growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts will be looking to see positive free cash flow and effective working capital management from the company as it seeks to create a stable foundation. In the previous quarter, Nio’s CEO, William Li, told investors on the company’s earnings call that he expects the company to break even on a full-year basis in 2026. That means the company’s upcoming earnings will have to show a continued trend of narrowing losses, driven by rising shipments and continued spending cuts.</span></p>
