<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been pressing higher into January but a rebound in February may have stalled with support at the 1.415 level ahead of the key number support at 1.40.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the US and Canadian economies will come late for the Hong Kong session but could spark some volatility in the pair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US retail sales come at 8:30pm HKT on Monday, with Canadian inflation data at the same time on Tuesday. But with a new Prime Minister, the price moves may be driven by geopolitics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Carney was a former governor of the Bank of England and has taken over from Justin Trudeau. One of his first mandates is to push back on Donald Trump’s designs on Canada as a new US state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his talks with Trudeau, Trump questioned the borders set in the 1908 Treaty signed by former President Teddy Roosevelt and King Edward VII.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World,&#8221; he said, adding that Canadians would pay &#8220;much less tax&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump moved quickly to add 25% tariffs on Canadian goods with aluminium and steel being hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We didn&#8217;t ask for this fight,&#8221; Carney said, but &#8220;the Americans want our resources, our water, our land and our country&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;America is not Canada. And Canada never ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form,&#8221; he added. Carney is keen on reciprocal tariffs against the US, even though he deplores them in principle, and said that &#8220;Canada will win&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short-term, the tariff wars could add to the volatility in the USDCAD and the battle for Canada’s sovereignty is an interesting distraction to economic data.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD v CAD made a sharp move higher on the Trump tariff launch but the pair has moved back to the previous highs. The rejection at higher levels sets up the next path with an uptrend line holding the bullish trend in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/analysis/economic-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic calendar</a> is light this week with the US waiting for ADP employment figures and an ISM services PMI release late on Wednesday. But, the market is ignoring short-term, lagging data as traders try to digest the effect of tariffs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tariff issue took another twist on Monday after President Trump said he would pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico for one month. Both countries have pledged to tighten their borders and Trump has applied a grace period on his 25% tariffs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada and Mexico both agreed to dispatch 10,000 additional troops to the border in order to support police in their fight against illegal migration and drug trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump wrote on social media that he had had a “very friendly” conversation with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and that the soldiers “will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets are in a state of confusion as tariffs could upset the global economy and worsen the deflationary effect on global countries. Trump also reiterated his desire for Canada to become the 51</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state of America. Canada’s Trudeau is against such an idea, but he was facing a potential vote of no confidence in his leadership this month. Trump’s moves were created due to trade imbalances with the likes of Canada. However, many analysts worry about supply and demand issues and the deflationary trend of tariffs. Trump has backed off on tariffs for now but that could change at any time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders should keep an eye on fx trades as the changing environment could lead to swings and new trends.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD &#8211; Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of USDCAD has soared since October as investors consider the possibility of trade tensions between China and the US under Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic Liberal caucus in Canada is now calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to step down as party leader. Following an Atlantic Liberal caucus meeting the morning of December 23, chair Kody Blois wrote a letter to Trudeau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The discussion this morning centred around the need for you to resign as the Leader of the Liberal Party and to urgently allow for a process to determine a new leader to replace you,&#8221; wrote Blois to Trudeau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible trade tensions and Donald Trump&#8217;s threatened 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods exported to the US, and the opposition parties saying they would support a vote of non-confidence in the new year, are reasons for urging Trudeau to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trudeau has been in charge since November of 2015 and many are seeking a change of path for Canada. Monday saw mixed data from the US with December MNI Chicago PMI unexpectedly falling -3.3 to a 7-month low of 36.9, weaker than expectations of an increase to 43. Pending home sales rose by 2.2% over the month, which beat expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low volumes and thin holiday trading conditions may see some exaggerated moves in different assets. The markets are now awaiting Friday’s December ISM manufacturing index for direction and to assess the health of manufacturing. Expectations are for the ISM Manufacturing Index to slip by -0.2 to 48.2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders are now discounting the chances at 11% for a -25 bp rate cut at the January 28-29 FOMC meeting after Jerome Powell took a hawkish stance at his latest monetary policy meeting.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD – Daily Chart </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the USDCAD exchange rate has pushed above 1.40 and will need the data to continue US dollar strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest data comes on Wednesday but traders are likely to see movement into the end of the week. US consumer prices are expected to tick higher by 0.1% and that would add to dollar strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bank of Canada interest rate decision will follow for the pair. Traders are expecting to see a 50 basis point cut from 3.75% to 3.25%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts are expecting the BoC to move ahead of Donald Trump’s tariffs on overseas goods. In June 2024, with inflation at 2.7%, the BoC began dropping its overnight rate. As of now, it’s sitting at 3.75%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large cut is not seen as a done deal with some analysts expecting a 0.25%. According to the BMO Canada Economic Outlook released last week, “since June, (BoC) has cut rates by 1.25 per cent, and we expect another cut during their final interest rate meeting in December, as well as a series of cuts through mid-2025. All told, we expect the overnight interest rate to fall from the current 3.75 per cent to 2.5 per cent by the middle of 2025. If anything, the Bank of Canada may be even more aggressive”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data released last week showed the jobless rate had climbed to 6.8%, which is the highest since 2021. That led economists at Scotiabank and the Bank of Montreal to join Canada’s four other major lenders in predicting officials will drop the BoC’s overnight lending rate half-a-per-cent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau travelled to meet Trump over threats of a blanket 25% tariff on Canadian goods when he takes office in January. Trump said he hopes the pair can &#8220;continue our in depth talks on Tariffs and Trade, the results of which will be truly spectacular for all&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada is one of America&#8217;s largest trading partners and it sends around 75% of its total exports to the US. The two countries also share deeply integrated supply chains. On Monday, Trudeau told the Halifax Chamber of Commerce that Canada will respond to the tariffs if they go ahead as planned on 20 January.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">USDCAD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDCAD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been trending lower from highs in early August. Resistance for a dollar rally stands at 1.3590 but there is potential to move lower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data starts late on Tuesday with US ISM Manufacturing PMI data. The market is expecting a rise from 46.8 to 47.8. A reading below is still in contraction territory and highlights weakness in the US manufacturing sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday evening brings balance of trade figures and a Bank of Canada rate decision. Economists are expecting another rate cut from governor Tiff Macklem. The BoC cut its key interest rate to 4.5% in July and Macklem said during a news conference that it would be reasonable to expect further rate cuts if inflation continues to ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cut was widely expected by economists after a slowdown in June inflation. It was the central bank&#8217;s second consecutive rate cut when it cut rates for the first time since March 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If inflation continues to ease broadly in line with our forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate,&#8221; Macklem said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian economy has been weaker than the economy in the United States but traders have started to sell the US dollar as the Federal Reserve embarks on its own path of monetary easing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data on Thursday will come from US services PMI and a stronger reading of 51.5 is expected. Services PMI makes up 90% of the economy and is an important number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts feel the Fed has been slow to start its own interest rate cuts.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think they don&#8217;t want to go beyond what they&#8217;ve already clearly communicated, all the way back in March, when they were suggesting at that time three rate cuts of 25 basis points each. We still have three meetings left. I think we still get those three rate cuts of 25 basis points each, and they&#8217;ll take a very gradual pace from that point forward until the Fed funds target rate gets back to 3%,” said Kevin Mahn at Hennion &amp; Walsh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday will bring employment data from Canada and the United States. With these data releases, the USDCAD will be given a clear path on where it goes next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both central banks reduce rates, traders will focus again on economic strength. Monday in the United States is labour day and many markets will be closed.</span></p>
