<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR v JPY found resistance at the 164.93 level that marked the high heading into 2025. A bearish daily close is in play and GDP could confirm a breakout higher or a correction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eurozone latest economic data on Thursday at 5pm HKT with employment figures and a preliminary GDP figure for Q1. Economists are expecting a reading of 0.4% for growth, with the full year expectation staying at 1.2%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A speech by ECB policymaker Luis De Guindos at 6:15pm could also add some fuel to a move before Friday. The European Central Bank is expected to lower borrowing costs more than previously expected this year after inflation came in lower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lithuania’s central-bank governor Gediminas Simkus told Bloomberg last week that another move in June is “needed” as the euro-area economy is yet to feel the effects of the recent tariffs and their “clear disinflationary forces”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said there were “chances that there might be another cut after June,” although the timing is open. Another cut could come in July, September or December, he added. Finland’s Olli Rehn also commented that he would back another move next month if the ECB’s new projections confirm the deflationary outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Downside risks in the data likely have to still materialize to convince the ECB to cut beyond a likely move in June,” said Greg Fuzesi at JPMorgan this week. “We continue to think that that will happen, even if Schnabel will take a lot of convincing,” he said, referring to Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba&#8217;s economic advisory panel recommended an investment of $400 billion to boost productivity at smaller firms, leading to some gains for the yen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attention now turns to the Q1 GDP figure for the Euro which could add to a correction if it shows weakness ahead of the recent tariffs.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46604" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURJPY – Daily Chart" width="814" height="560" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 814w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x206.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x528.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURJPY – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR v JPY was able to mount a sharp rally from the support near 155 and has resistance ahead at the 161.245 level. A breakout above that could look to move through some resistance toward 165.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan&#8217;s real wages dropped in January after two months of small gains, data showed on Monday. That was released days before the end of the annual pay negotiations held each spring at the country&#8217;s major firms. Despite regular pay rising by the most in more than 30 years and overtime pay increasing, inflation at a two-year high dragged down real wages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Japan is now expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its next policy meeting on March 18-19. BOJ officials have repeatedly talked of a desire for sustainable wage growth after the central bank&#8217;s January rate hike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation-adjusted real wages dropped 1.8% in January from a year earlier, labour ministry data showed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Inflation in Europe eased to an annual 2.4% in February, supporting the calls for another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank. However, the inability to find strong growth casts a shadow on the rate discussion and may require larger cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drop in consumer price inflation figure supports the view that the ECB is succeeding in its battle to get inflation back to its target of 2%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth worries have returned after the eurozone stagnated in the last three months of 2024. Consumers are still hurting from the outbreak of inflation and are cautious in their spending habits. Businesses are now concerned about possible new tariffs on exports to the US under President Donald Trump. After years of economic struggle, tariffs would only worsen the situation and the fallout with the US over Ukraine also means that the decision to ramp up defense spending could keep Europe’s economy trapped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near-term, the euro will look to keep the current rally going unless Japan’s GDP data can boost expectations.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURJPY &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURJPY has lost the strength it had into late-November and is tumbling to support at 158.20. Another level comes in below around 156 which would bring the spike 2024 low in play. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a battle over the country&#8217;s budget and an ongoing fiscal crisis, France&#8217;s 10 year yield spread to Germany has soared up to over 85bps &#8211; its highest since the European financial crisis &#8211; reigniting &#8216;Frexit&#8217; fears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The French government is facing higher borrowing costs as its lack of a majority in Parliament makes it harder to implement spending cuts and tax hikes needed to slow the country’s ballooning budget deficit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recently appointed Prime Minister Michel Barnier said: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There will probably be a rather serious storm and serious turbulence in financial markets” if there is a no-confidence vote in his government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the government falls, emergency measures will be taken,” which will miss full-year expenses.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg said Barnier’s political survival hangs on rival leader Marine Le Pen’s plan to back a potential no-confidence vote when he presents final versions of the 2025 government and social-security budget bills in the coming days and weeks. Le Pen has said she will bring down his administration if her demands to better protect households aren’t met. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Le Pen has reacted angrily to the government’s plan to increase taxes on electricity, lower medicine support, and delay a link between pensions and inflation. She has also demanded additional measures to tackle immigration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnier said on Tuesday that electricity prices will fall by 9% next year, “and we’ll see if we can do more to preserve the purchasing power of the French”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We could very well come to a situation where the government is again put into jeopardy,” said Greg Hirt, global chief investment officer for Allianz Global Investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest woes come amidst a backdrop of economic decline in both France and Germany, while there is also the tension between Russia and Ukraine on Europe’s doorstep. The yen’s previous status as a safe haven could be returning with all of these dramas unfolding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday will bring consumer confidence data for the euro at 6pm HKT, while Friday at 7:30am is Japan inflation and employment data.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41822" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURJPY – Daily Chart" width="795" height="613" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 795w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x231.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x592.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of EURJPY is probing the resistance at 163 again after the level has been an obstacle since the bounce in August. Getting above 164 would create a larger recovery for the euro. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese economy has CPI inflation numbers ahead on Friday which are set for 7:30 am HKT. A sharp drop Is expected from the 2.8% last month to 2.3% this month. The outlook for Japanese rates is important as the ECB continues to cut rates closer to the Japanese level each time. That has been the reason for the weak bounce in the euro from the carry trade unwind into August. Talk of the Bank of Japan has disappeared from view after the yen surge that rattled markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ECB does not expect the bloc to slide into recession as it cut rates on Thursday in the wake of recent data showing inflation across the bloc falling to its lowest level in three years, with economic growth waning. The governing council reduced rates from 3.5% to 3.25%, marking the third reduction since June. The “disinflationary process is well on track,” a statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to revised figures on Thursday, inflation in the eurozone sank to 1.7% in September, well below the ECB’s target rate of 2%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ECB predicted a brief rise in inflation during the coming months, before a return to its target next year. ECB President Christine Lagarde gave little away in the press conference about a potential December rate cut, saying the bank is “not pre-committing to a particular rate path.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any decision will “follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach,” she added. However, one takeaway from the event was that the central bank said economic activity had come in “somewhat weaker than expected,” noting a contraction in the manufacturing sector and weaker exports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Germany seeing output shrink in the second quarter by 0.1%, Lagarde said that she didn&#8217;t expect the eurozone economy to fall into recession, but that downside risks could come from the Middle East and any new tariffs that Donald Trump may impose on European goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although the ECB did not pre-commit to any specific rate path, we believe that downside risks to growth in a context of easing inflationary pressure will lead to more rate cuts starting in December and continuing in 2025,” said EFG Asset Management.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany&#8217;s economic prospects took a dramatic shift on Tuesday with a deepening slump in confidence for the eurozone&#8217;s largest economy. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40723" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURJPY – Daily Chart" width="838" height="606" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart.png 838w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart-300x217.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/EURJPY-–-Daily-Chart-768x555.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURJPY – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURJPY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange rate has tumbled from the July highs of 175 and now trades at 156.71. The last two days have been a weak bounce and could lead to further lows. Support comes in below 153.88 and that is creating a breakout zone for further tests of support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany’s ZEW Economic Sentiment Index, a key measure of economic sentiment among financial experts, dropped sharply from 19.2 points in August to just 3.6 points in September, well below analysts’ forecasts of 17 points. That was the lowest level since October 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sub-index measuring current conditions also fell sharply to -84.5 points, down from -77.3 points in August and below expectations of -80 points. It is the weakest reading since May 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The hope for a swift improvement in the economic situation is visibly fading,&#8221; ZEW President Achim Wambach said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations for the coming six months have worsened across many industries, with the steepest declines seen in mechanical engineering, steel, automotive, and banking. Construction, utilities, and telecommunications sectors experienced a more optimistic outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weakness in Germany&#8217;s economy also affected the broader eurozone, where the ZEW sentiment index dropped from 17.9 points to 9.3 points in September, with expectations for 16.3 points and also its lowest in nearly a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although the falling economic expectations for the eurozone point to an overall rise in pessimism, the drop in expectations for Germany is significantly greater. Most respondents appear to have already factored the interest rate decision into their expectations,&#8221; added Wambach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council member, Peter Kazimir, dismissed hopes for a consecutive interest rate cut in October, suggesting that December would be a more likely opportunity. That helped to boost the EURJPY despite the economic warning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It would require a significant shift, a powerful signal, concerning the outlook to consider backing another cut in October,&#8221; Kazimir said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EURJPY has tumbled from the previous highs and the lower levels look more likely before any recovery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of the EURJPY has bounced from recent lows to 162.26. The next barrier to the rebound is at 164.25. Support comes in around the 158.15 level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eurozone inflation on Monday showed a 2.9% increase in core inflation, which was in line with previous readings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following vital data set and the recent European Central Bank meeting minutes will be on Thursday. That will be released after a German manufacturing PMI release at 15:30 HKT on Thursday. The former manufacturing and export powerhouse has been struggling in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany and the Eurozone&#8217;s economic sentiment collapsed in August, raising fears over the economic outlook. The ZEW Economic Sentiment Index, which measures the financial outlook for Germany and the Eurozone over the next six months, dropped more than 20 points between July and August, from 41.8 to 19.2. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eurozone&#8217;s economic sentiment was also plunging, with the index hitting its lowest since February and dropping well below the expected 35.4, moving from 43.7 to 17.9 points. That was the worst slowdown in the Eurozone&#8217;s economic morale since April 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessing the recent survey results, ZEW Professor Achim Wambach said: &#8220;The economic outlook for Germany is breaking down. In the current survey, we observe the strongest decline of the economic expectations over the past two years.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Wambach said that fears of a larger war in the Middle East, an ambiguous monetary policy by Olaf Scholz&#8217;s government, and disappointing business data from the US have contributed to the decline in the economic sentiment. The German economy is also seeing a severe slowdown in exports to China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Japanese economy, inflation numbers will be released at 7:30 am HKT on Friday. A recent interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan shocked the market, and if inflation remains high, then the BOJ may feel pressure to take rates higher again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Japan&#8217;s economy grew by a faster-than-expected 3.1% in the second quarter, rebounding from a slump at the beginning of the year thanks to a substantial rise in consumption. That is also adding to calls for another near-term interest rate hike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of Japan forecasts that a solid economic recovery will help inflation sustainably hit its 2% target and justify raising interest rates further. A slowdown in Europe, alongside a more robust Japanese economy, could lead to further gains for the yen.</span></p>
