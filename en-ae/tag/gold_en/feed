<h2><strong>Gold Prices Hit Record Highs Despite Strong Dollar</strong></h2>
<p>Gold prices (<a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XAUUSD</a>) surged to unprecedented levels on Monday, defying a stronger U.S. dollar after President Donald Trump announced fresh trade tariffs targeting commodity imports. The escalating trade tensions fueled investor demand for safe-haven assets, particularly gold.</p>
<p>As of 3:30 p.m. ET (20:30 GMT), spot gold climbed 1.5% to $2,904.19 per ounce, after reaching an all-time high of $2,911.44 earlier in the day. Gold futures for April delivery also soared, rising 1.6% to $2,933.61 per ounce.</p>
<h2><strong>U.S. Tariff Announcements Drive Gold Demand</strong></h2>
<p>The surge in gold prices follows President Trump’s announcement on Sunday of a 25% tariff on all aluminum and steel imports to the U.S. This move has heightened concerns over potential disruptions to global trade, prompting investors to flock to gold as a reliable hedge against economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump indicated <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/trading-strategies/trump-2025-administration-impact-on-key-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans for reciprocal tariffs</a>, aiming to align U.S. import duties with those of its trading partners. This announcement closely follows the implementation of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, which triggered retaliatory measures from Beijing.</p>
<h2><strong>Escalating Trade War Fuels Economic Concerns<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The new tariffs have intensified fears of an escalating trade war between the world’s largest economies. Analysts warn that prolonged trade conflicts could stifle global economic growth and disrupt international trade flows.</p>
<p>“Gold has already surged over 10% year-to-date, achieving consecutive record highs. Concerns over tariffs potentially driving higher inflation and slower economic growth are boosting demand for safe-haven assets like gold,” noted analysts at ING.</p>
<h2><strong>Precious Metals Market Sees Broad Gains<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The rally in gold prices also lifted other precious metals. Silver futures edged up 0.1% to $32.468 per ounce, while platinum futures advanced 1.3% to $1,034.40 per ounce.</p>
<h2><strong>Impact on Industrial Metals Amid Market Uncertainty<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Industrial metals faced mixed reactions amid the tariff news. Benchmark copper futures on the London Metal Exchange remained flat at $9,468.00 per ton, whereas March copper futures gained 2.4% to $4.7008 per pound.</p>
<p>“With Trump back in the White House, market volatility and unpredictability are at heightened levels. Ongoing trade disputes are likely to dampen global growth and weaken demand for industrial metals,” ING added.</p>
<h2><strong>Federal Reserve, Inflation Data in Focus<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Looking ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver his semiannual monetary policy testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. Market participants will closely monitor his comments for insights into how potential tariffs might impact the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Economists and Federal Reserve officials have cautioned that the new tariffs, which will primarily affect U.S. importers, could contribute to rising inflation, reducing the likelihood of interest rate cuts. Additionally, January&#8217;s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, set to be released later this week, is expected to influence future interest rate decisions.</p>

		<title>Gold Weakened after the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Hawkish Tilt</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/live-chart/gold-price">Gold prices</a> dipped on Friday, marking a lower weekly close as rising US Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s hawkish stance overshadowed the yellow metal. Spot gold declined by 0.7% to $2,614.40 per ounce, while February gold futures slipped 0.9%, settling at $2,630.36 per ounce.</p>
<p>The trading atmosphere remained subdued, with many institutional investors winding down for the holiday season. The year-end slowdown typically results in thinner trading volumes and muted price activity. Additionally, the lack of significant economic data or major policy announcements toward the year&#8217;s end often limits market catalysts.</p>
<p>Despite Friday’s dip, gold was still on track to inch up by 0.3% for the week, recovering slightly from a 1% decline in the previous week. However, a stronger US dollar bolstered by the Fed’s reaffirmation of restrictive monetary policy continues to weigh heavily on gold’s performance.</p>
<h2>Rising Yields Push Gold Prices Down</h2>
<p>The US Dollar Index softened slightly on Friday, retracting overnight gains but remained near its two-year high. However, sharply higher Treasury yields outpaced any potential boost from the dollar’s weakness, keeping gold under pressure.</p>
<p>Typically, gold prices benefit from a weaker dollar, as it makes the metal more affordable for international buyers. However, higher interest rates, spurred by hawkish Fed policy, make interest-bearing assets like bonds more appealing than non-yielding gold, leading to sustained downward pressure.</p>
<p>This week’s gold decline followed the Federal Reserve’s revised projections of only two interest rate cuts in 2025, down from the previously anticipated four. The adjustment signaled the Fed&#8217;s intent to maintain tighter monetary policy for longer, reinforcing an environment less favorable for gold.</p>
<p>Other precious metals mirrored gold’s downward trajectory. Platinum futures plunged by 3.6% to $919.90 per ounce, while silver futures dropped 1.5% to $29.935 per ounce.</p>
<h2>Copper Gains on Supply Constraints but Faces Dollar Headwinds</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, industrial metals like copper saw mixed performance. Copper prices edged higher after reports highlighted a continued shortage of copper concentrates in China. Reuters revealed that leading Chinese copper smelters have reduced their processing charge guidance for the first quarter of 2025, reflecting tightening supply. The new treatment and refining rates were set at $25 per metric ton and 2.5 cents per pound, significantly lower than the fourth-quarter figures of $35 per ton and 3.5 cents per pound.</p>
<p>This supply constraint drove benchmark copper futures on the London Metal Exchange up 0.4%, closing at $8,995.00 per ton. However, February copper futures fell slightly by 0.1% to $4.1242 per pound, as a strong dollar capped potential gains.</p>
<p>Although supply shortages suggest potential support for copper prices in the coming months, the robust dollar continues to challenge the broader industrial metals market, limiting immediate upside potential.</p>
<p>Outlook: As 2024 concludes, gold and other precious metals may remain vulnerable to fluctuations in Treasury yields and the dollar. Meanwhile, copper and other industrial metals will likely hinge on global supply-demand dynamics, particularly in key markets like China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/live-chart/gold-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold prices (Spot Gold: XAUUSD)</a> reached an all-time high on Wednesday, driven by heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid growing political uncertainties in the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>Initially, gold saw a subdued start to the week as a less intense-than-anticipated Israeli attack on Iran suggested a possible easing in Middle Eastern tensions.</p>
<p>However, the upcoming <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/financial-events/us-presidential-election-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 U.S. presidential election</a> on November 5 has kept the demand for safe-haven investments strong. The political uncertainty in Japan also rose after a coalition led by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in a recent election, further fueling the demand for safe-haven assets.</p>
<p>Spot gold increased by 0.4% to $2,785.47 per ounce, hitting a record high of $2,790.01 earlier in the day, while December gold futures rose 0.6% to $2,796.85 per ounce.</p>
<p>With the U.S. presidential election drawing near, markets remained tense as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris continued in a close race. Recent polls showed Trump gaining a slight edge, though analysts considered the outcome too close to predict.</p>
<p>In Japan, the LDP&#8217;s recent election loss introduced further uncertainty, as it must seek alliances with regional parties to govern effectively, potentially weakening its influence. In the Middle East, tensions persisted, with Iran vowing to retaliate for recent Israeli strikes and Israel maintaining military actions against Hamas and Hezbollah, suggesting limited room for de-escalation.</p>
<p>Economic and interest rate data, such as the U.S. third-quarter GDP data, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge, and nonfarm payrolls, are playing a significant role in shaping investor sentiment. These releases precede a Federal Reserve meeting, where a modest rate cut of 25 basis points is anticipated. Lower U.S. interest rates are typically favourable for non-yielding assets like gold.</p>
<p>Safe-haven demand also supported other <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precious metals</a>, with platinum futures down 3.7% to $1,020.20 per ounce and silver futures falling 1.5% to $33.94 per ounce. In industrial metals, London Metal Exchange copper futures rose by 0.1% to $9,564.00 per ton but faced significant losses for October.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40065" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Gold-Daily-Chart.png" alt="Gold - Daily Chart" width="954" height="594" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Gold-Daily-Chart.png 954w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Gold-Daily-Chart-300x187.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Gold-Daily-Chart-768x478.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Gold &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of gold has moved to touch the recent breakout trend line and has moved back toward the recent highs around the $2,525 level. The recent support is vital for the path forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has been moving higher as the Federal Reserve moves to a dovish tone and signals interest rate cuts ahead. PCE pricing data on Friday from the United States will have a bearing on inflation and gold’s outlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold had slipped earlier in the week with a stronger US dollar as investors buy the US currency for month-end portfolio rebalancing. US data this week has failed to boost gold with GDP data coming in stronger at 3% versus 2.8% and that was dollar positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders will now look at the inflation figures on Friday, which may provide further evidence for the Fed Chair Jerome Powell after he said last week the “time has come” to ease borrowing costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest World Gold Council report said global gold </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/etf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced their strongest month since April 2022, with $3.7bn in July, the third consecutive monthly inflow. Money came in from all regions with Western funds leading the way </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent inflows and the rise in the price of gold have pushed the total AUM of global gold ETFs to $246bn. Collective holdings rebounded to 3,154t, which is the highest since January </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North American funds saw inflows of US$2bn, which reversed minor outflows from May and June. Continued tension between Russia and Ukraine has fuelled the rally in bullion, alongside a failure to secure a ceasefire in the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The path ahead in gold will rely on these dynamics with the inflation figures on Friday possibly confirming a rate cut in September. A lower-than-expected inflation number could drive gold further.</span></p>
