<p style="text-align: center;">EURAUD – Daily Chart</p>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURAUD</a> is still reeling from a sharp move that started in February. The Aussie dollar will need some positive data to help spur a rebound.</p>
<p>Australia’s economy will see the release of employment figures at 9:30am HKT with a reading of 4.2% expected on the unemployment rate- a 0.1% rise despite an expected increase in jobs of 20k. That is a reverse from last month’s loss of 52.8k jobs and is a far cry from some post-pandemic resilience in the job market. Job vacancies were seen as a sign of strength but are now down 30% since May 2022 in the country.</p>
<p>At 2 pm, there is some medium-level data with German producer prices and 8:15 pm is the next high-level data with European Central Bank data releases on monetary policy.</p>
<p>The Australian exchange rates will be awaiting the election on May 3 before making any radical price swings. The post-election period could see further rate cuts from the country’s central bank as it needs to spur some growth in the economy, but possible inflation and upheaval from tariffs could make it harder to achieve.</p>
<p>His rival Peter Dutton has promised changes to consumers if he is elected as part of the coalition. The Coalition has pledged to slash fuel excise by 25 cents per litre, in a bid to help ease financial pressure on Aussies struggling with a “cost of living crisis,” which is a term repeated often on Australian networks. Mr Dutton has also made promises around housing, offering $1,200 tax cuts to help first home buyers.</p>
<p>The post-election period could see further rate cuts from the country’s central bank as it needs to spur some growth in the economy, but possible inflation and upheaval from tariffs could make it harder to achieve.</p>
<p>Recent financial plans have seen debt growing in Australia as economic growth slows down. DPG Advisory Solutions’ David Gazard has predicted Australia could face a period of “prolonged economic insecurity”.</p>
<p>He pointed to the slower growth in the Chinese economy, with instability in the US as headwinds for Australia. With the election two weeks away, it will be a few months before any rate cut can take effect and tariffs could hurt until that time, worsening the outlook.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45412" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EURAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURAUD – Daily Chart" width="717" height="517" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EURAUD-–-Daily-Chart.png 717w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EURAUD-–-Daily-Chart-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURAUD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EUR v AUD has hit an obstacle at 1.67843 and there is support at 1.6493 if the pair wants to move back into the trading range. Those two levels will be important for any future breakout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian retail sales data is released at 8:30am HKT with analysts expecting a reading of -0.8% which would be a downfall from 0.8% in the previous month. That highlights that a holiday boost in spending has regressed back to the pressured consumer environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eurozone consumer price inflation data is released at 6pm HKT with markets expecting a slight dip from 2.7% to 2.6% annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market is still digesting the recent rate cut from the European Central Bank last week. The ECB decided to cut its benchmark rate by 0.25% as France and Germany struggle to create growth. The euro may be pulling back as investors see that trend continue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the eurozone was “set to remain weak in the near term” after cutting rates to 2.75%. The latest cut is the fifth since June and markets expect two or three more this year due to economic fears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further uncertainty is coming from Donald Trump’s tariff threat and the Australian dollar may be seen as a safe haven and the EUR v AUD could dip back to support levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exchange rate will also be driven by the dynamics of the Australian economy and interest rate. Finance expert Mark Bouris has said that the Reserve Bank of Australia should cut interest rates, saying Aussie monetary policy is pushing businesses and individuals to the brink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two years, business closures have surged to 26,000 which is a record. November 2023 was severe with the highest number of monthly business closures on record, with 1,442 businesses shutting down in one month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The medium-term trends are a worry for both economies but the short-term will be driven this week by retail, inflation and tariff talk.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">EURAUD – Daily Chart</p>
<p>The price of EURAUD has rallied from lows in late November to a high at 1.6800 in December. The price has now dipped back to 1.6580, and 1.6500 is key support.</p>
<p>Data on Wednesday starts at 8:30 am HKT with the release of monthly consumer price data from Australia. Analysts expect a rise from 2.1% to 2.2% as consumers struggle with price rises despite stubborn interest rates.</p>
<p>A slowing Australian economy through 2024 caused many economists to raise their forecasts for interest rate cuts in 2025 and pull forward the timing. The market is now pricing in at least three 0.25% cuts by around the middle of 2025. However, the medium-to-long-term Reserve Bank cash rate is now expected to settle at a higher level than previously thought.</p>
<p>Lower interest rate expectations have led to weakness in the Aussie dollar, and the RBA is in a hard place, with the RBA&#8217;s preferred measure of Aussie inflation remaining substantially above its target range. Still, the economy needs lower rates to boost activity. Higher CPI data on Wednesday could add to fears over the Australian situation.</p>
<p>According to analysts, Australian home prices are predicted to keep falling in the first half of this year, but they also expect a small and short-lived decline. Data from CoreLogic and PropTrack both showed Australian home values posting their first monthly decline in around two years in December.</p>
<p>&#8220;A cyclical downswing is likely for early 2025 but it may not be large,&#8221; according to CoreLogic.</p>
<p>European data comes at 3 pm HKT from Europe&#8217;s largest economy with German factory orders and retail sales. The latter will be the key number, with economists expecting a move from 1% last month to 1.9%.</p>
<p>German industry has struggled in recent years, and a colder winter now leaves the sector at risk, as Europe burned through its gas reserves at the fastest pace over the last seven years. That raises the risk of an energy shortage in the country if the winter extends further into the New Year.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar&#8217;s weakness may have gone too far with higher interest rates, but the economy is hurting the dollar&#8217;s performance.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURAUD – Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of EURAUD dipped on Friday ahead of resistance at the 1.6627 level. That will be the barrier to further gains in the pair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/economic-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economic calendar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the week starts with TD-MI inflation from Australia at 8 am HKT. That will be followed at 8:30 am with ANZ job advertisements for October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will move to Europe where a busy day of manufacturing data for October includes data from Spain, France, Germany, and the Eurozone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The euro has bounced against the Australian dollar recently, despite an imbalance in interest rates. The Australian Reserve Bank meets on Monday and will deliver its latest interest rate decision on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts do not expect to see any change from the RBA on Tuesday and the major banks differ on their expectations for an initial rate cut. ANZ bank expects rates to drop in February. Commonwealth Bank and Westpac also agree on the February timeframe and NAB stands alone with a March expectation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eurozone money markets are now pricing in a terminal rate of around 1.80%, which is well below the ECB&#8217;s current policy rate of 3.25%. Economists at the major banks think the ECB will need to go further and potentially cut rates by 50 basis points per meeting over the next six months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see risks that markets might eventually price a terminal rate marginally below 1.50%,&#8221; Nomura analysts wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists at Morgan Stanley stated that the ECB&#8217;s nominal rate might even be as low as 1.0-1.4%. This factors in a 2% inflation target and accounts for a weak economy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs data from the Australian economy and inflation data from Europe can drive the EUR v AUD exchange rate on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41779" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EURAUD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="EURAUD - Daily Chart" width="892" height="622" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EURAUD-Daily-Chart.png 892w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EURAUD-Daily-Chart-300x209.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EURAUD-Daily-Chart-768x536.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">EURAUD &#8211; Daily Chart </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURAUD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at recent resistance around the 1.63 level and is seeking a catalyst for the next path. Support for further Aussie strength comes in at 1.60-1.61505 and the larger target is 1.5850. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian jobs data will be released on Thursday morning at 8:30 am HKT, with the release of European CPI inflation following at 5pm HKT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank’s analysts expect to see Canadian CPI at 1.8% year-on-year when it is released later on Tuesday. That data is released at 8:30 pm HKT, but traders can catch the UK employment rate at 2pm HKT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsche Bank chief economist Phil O&#8217;donoghue said last month that Australia’s unemployment rate would be much higher if employers were not hoarding labour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Australia’s unemployment rate is lower than it should be because most of the adjustment to lower labour demand has occurred through hours worked, rather than through employment”, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We estimate that the unemployment rate would be closer to 5.25% if employment growth had matched the slowdown in hours worked”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists are expecting higher unemployment on Thursday when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases its monthly figures. Joblessness is expected to have hit 4.3% in September despite an additional 15,000 jobs being created. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European CPI inflation is expected later and investors will take heart that the UK number fell to a three-month low of 1.7%. That will create calls for another rate cut and traders should look for a similar take from the European number after French inflation fell this week. The euro’s rally could falter on a low inflation number.</span></p>
