										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XAGUSD: A rush for physical silver has helped to push prices toward recent highs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47442 aligncenter" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart.png" alt="xagusd,silver,spot" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart.png 840w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart-300x200.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xagusd-weeklychart-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">XAGUSD &#8211; Weekly Chart</span></p>
<p>The price of XAGUSD is approaching recent resistance at $34.20 and a breakout higher could another leg to the rally.</p>
<p>In recent months, there has been a drive to bring physical silver onshore to the United States, leading to a sharp rise in COMEX inventories, which are 60% higher since December.</p>
<p>While the official explanation points to potential tariffs from the Trump administration on imported silver, there may be other reasons for the scramble. Further confirming the scramble for physical silver has been a surge in trading volume since December in the Sprott Physical Silver Trust, the most well-known physically backed silver exchange-traded product. The non-physically backed iShares Silver Trust has been flat over the same period, highlighting a clear investor preference for products backed by real silver.</p>
<p>Another reason for the recent surge is that <a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/markets/commodities/gold-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold has hit new highs</a> this year. Over the past year, gold has outperformed, while silver has lagged, but the dynamic may be about to shift. Silver remains deeply undervalued relative to gold, and a correction in that dynamic may be imminent.</p>
<p>With gold now holding the level above the key $3,000 psychological level, the bias remains to the upside. This continued bullish momentum in gold should create a strong tailwind for silver moving forward.</p>
<p>Silver’s outlook is increasingly tied to the inflation narrative playing out in the global economy. President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, set to take effect April 2, are widely expected to boost import prices. Economists estimate the inflation impact could exceed a full percentage point, while Fed officials anticipate a temporary spike, others warn of longer-lasting pressure, adding uncertainty to interest rate decisions​​.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">silver (XAGUSD)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has soared to a new yearly high, following the strength of gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41914" src="https://www.atfx.com.bz/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/XAGUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png" alt="XAGUSD – Daily Chart" width="954" height="579" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/XAGUSD-–-Daily-Chart.png 954w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/XAGUSD-–-Daily-Chart-300x182.png 300w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/XAGUSD-–-Daily-Chart-768x466.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">XAGUSD – Daily Chart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of XAG soared above the all-time high mear $42.50 yesterday and that has the potential to spur further gains in the metal. The previous high will act as support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver is following the recent strength of gold as investors price in geopolitical instability and also see lower interest rates boosting the price of metals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the </span><a href="https://www.atfx.com.bz/en-ae/analysis/financial-events/us-presidential-election-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approaches, some high-profile business commentators are concerned that neither candidate is talking about the country’s budget deficit woes. That is helping to boost the price of safe haven assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US budget deficit grew to $1.833 trillion for 2024, the highest since the pandemic, as interest payments on federal debt exceeded $1 trillion for the first time and spending grew for Social Security retirement, health care, and the military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, has estimated that Trump&#8217;s plans would add $7.5 trillion in new debt, more than twice the $3.5 trillion envisaged from Harris&#8217; proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither candidate is talking of measures to right the ballooning debt and investors are turning to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold and silver</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they fear the US dollar losing its purchasing power. The biggest driver of the 2024 deficit level was a 29% increase in interest costs to $1.13 trillion due to a combination of higher interest rates and more debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Larry Fink, CEO of asset management giant BlackRock, said that growth in private markets could mitigate the economic impact of deficits and high government debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, he said rising US debt is a &#8220;big problem&#8221; but that private capital markets can help the economy grow without adding to the deficit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real risk would be a slowdown in growth and that could see even more flows into alternative assets such as Bitcoin and gold/silver.</span></p>
