<p>The USDX has bounced above the 100 level and will need to find continued buyers to defend that area. A move to 104 would be the first target for the dollar.</p>
<p>The dollar has been on a rollercoaster move with highs near 110 after Trump’s election win. This year has seen confidence erode and analysts were bearish on the dollar’s role in the markets around a week ago.</p>
<p>“We don’t believe this is a short-term wobble. It’s the opening phase of a steady but far-reaching shift,” said Nigel Green, CEO of Devere Group.</p>
<p>“Dollar supremacy isn’t vanishing overnight, but its era of unquestioned dominance is fading. This decline is not a crash – it’s erosion”.</p>
<p>His comments were based on the idea that countries are looking to expand their customer base after the recent tariff chaos.</p>
<p>“There’s growing discomfort with the idea of the dollar being used as a political instrument,” which could create a “more fragmented system” in <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/forex-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currencies</a>.</p>
<p>The recent easing of tariffs between the United States and China has seen confidence return to the dollar in the short-term. However, it remains to be seen how much other nations can diversify. Chinese exports rose 8% over the year in April as companies rushed to avoid the incoming tariffs.</p>
<p>China has also complained about a US trade deal with the United Kingdom, which it sees as a means to hurt the country’s economy. Beijing said that the “basic principle” of trade deals is that they should not target other nations. The complaint is that Chinese exports to the UK cannot be used for leverage against the US.</p>
<p>The short-term trend is a bounce in the US dollar after a possibly overdone move. There could still be further tension over the coming weeks if the 90-day tariff pause carries on without any hint of a longer deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The USDX dollar index has had a rough few weeks, and there is further risk as Trump turns his focus to the Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s job.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48185" src="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDX-–-Weekly-Chart.webp" alt="USDX – Weekly Chart" width="589" height="390" srcset="https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDX-–-Weekly-Chart.webp 589w, https://www.atfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/USDX-–-Weekly-Chart-300x199.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">USDX – Weekly Chart</p>
<p>The USDX broke lower through the key 100 level but has supported a little lower at 99.62. It is vital for the <a href="https://www.atfx.com/en-ae/markets/indices-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a> to find strength here, or further volatility can appear in markets.</p>
<p>After rocking the financial markets with tariffs, the U.S. President has been commenting on the future of the central bank head. Powell has been talking publicly about the tariffs causing inflation, which will hurt Trump&#8217;s desire to cut interest.</p>
<p>There is uncertainty over Trump&#8217;s ability to remove the head of the central bank. However, Trump said defiantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I want him out, he&#8217;ll be out of there real fast, believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recent upheaval in financial markets threatens the dollar&#8217;s status as the world&#8217;s reserve currency. The President added that he was &#8220;not happy&#8221; with Powell and said he was &#8220;playing politics&#8221; with interest rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a Federal Reserve chairman that is playing politics. Somebody that I&#8217;ve never been very fond of. &#8230; Interest rates should be down now&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump has been discussing firing the Fed Chair for months. He also made a strong statement on social media about Powell&#8217;s recent comments, noting the European Central Bank&#8217;s plan to cut interest rates for the 7th time. He said Powell was &#8220;too late and wrong&#8221; and should have lowered rates long ago.</p>
<p>Some European and U.S. markets are closed on Friday for the Easter holidays and may see quieter trading.</p>
<p>There is hope for the dollar at current support, and traders should keep an eye on trade negotiations for a potential rally. Several Asian countries have started talks with the U.S., but China has not. If they remain stubborn, the economy and the dollar could continue struggling. China was unhappy with the public attention to tariffs and the President&#8217;s &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; tone.</p>
<p>Japanese delegates were at the White House this week, but Trump said there was &#8220;no rush&#8221; to announce any deals at the summit.</p>
